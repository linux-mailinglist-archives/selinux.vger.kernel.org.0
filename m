Forgot to hit "reply all"

I think one reboot should be enough but i don't see how you would do
it without rebooting at all.
By adding selinux=1 on the kernel boot line you effectively disable
apparmor (the apparmor service unit has a condition that disables when
selinux=1 i believe)
You dont need that selinux-activate script either. The pam config
should be set up out of the box.
all that remains it the kernel boot options and relabel AFAIK. The
boot options can be added without booting by editing /etc/default/grub
and running update-grub, but relabeling requires a reboot.

Enabling SELinux is actually amazingly simple considering the circumstances.
