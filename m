All the non-LSM changes are almost cleared from my part.

I would suggest that we scrape v21 together as soon as you return from
your vacation discluding the LSM hooks.

There is no any particular reason to get the LSM changes to the mainline
before the SGX foundations so now is the right time close things
underlying them.

I'm now in the same boat with your changes to the ioctl API, which means
that we are ready to go. I feel a tiny bit bad that it took me so long
time with [1] but I'm a simple minded person so what I can do :-)

Once you can come back please deal with the suggestions that I made
and provide a "pure" SRCU patch (apologies for repeating myself). I
will the squash them to the existing patch set.

After that is fully done we can make v21 scope decision when it comes
to the enclave life-cycle.

Even if the LSM changes  would not be upstreamed as part of the
foundations I can start holding versions of them in my tree but only
after v21 is out.

Can you cope with this plan?
