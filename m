My $0.02, roughly in order from what I think will be the largest 
obstacles to merging to the smallest:

1) Changes outside of the security subsystem:
   1a) Userspace API changes e.g. /proc/self/attr/context, 
/proc/self/attr/display, and SO_PEERCONTEXT, likely needs vetting by 
linux-api and the latter by netdev, and audit record changes, needs 
vetting by linux-audit.
   1b) lsmblob changes to core kernel data structures and code, likely 
needs vetting by relevant subsystem maintainers e.g. netdev for 
unix_skb_parms and scm_cookie changes, linux-audit for audit changes, ...
    Whether or not these changes are deemed acceptable by their 
respective maintainers is key to whether this patch set is viable 
irrespective of what any LSM or security module maintainer may think.

2) Controlling setting of /proc/pid/attr/display:
    CAP_MAC_ADMIN isn't an appropriate check for this operation for 
SELinux. The security modules need to be able to provide their own 
access control logic for setting display just as with the other 
attributes, which they could do if you just called the hooks prior to 
setting the display.  At present, in SELinux, CAP_MAC_ADMIN is used only 
to control what processes can get or set file security labels that are 
unknown to the currently loaded policy, as a means of supporting package 
managers that might set down file security labels before loading new 
policy modules or OS image generators that might be generating a 
filesystem image with a policy that differs from the build host OS 
policy. The set of processes that need that ability are quite different 
from the set of processes that will need to set the display, and we do 
not want to conflate them in policy.  I think you are worried that if 
given the opportunity, the security module authors will just block 
setting the display to any value other than their own or setting it at 
all.  How about we just agree to not do that, and if you see a patch 
doing that you can NAK it?

3) Code review and testing by at least the major LSM maintainers:
   At least an Acked-by and preferably Reviewed-by and Tested-by lines 
from the major security module maintainers, not only for changes that 
directly touch the code of their module but all of the patches in the 
series.  Because any of these changes could break or undermine the 
security of any of the security modules.
   Testing also needs to cover new functionality that wasn't previously 
possible, e.g. the new userspace APIs, actual stacking of AA with other 
modules, etc.  So merely running existing testsuites isn't going to suffice.
