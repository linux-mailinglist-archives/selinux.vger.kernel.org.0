The main purpose of Fedora CI is to test Fedora packages either when they'r=
e
built or when there's a pull request in pagure frontend [1]. It's configure=
d via
tests/tests.yml [2] file.

In Fedora we use a set of integration tests originally used in Red Hat [3]

I've created "Run upstream tests on upstream sources" pull request [4] whic=
h
disables RH tests and add "upstream" test. This tests clones github reposit=
ory,
build and install sources and runs `make test` from subdirectories. It's ki=
nd of
hack but seems to work [5]. I'd like to enable also Red Hat based tests for=
 this
"upstream" test to get more and better results.

AFAIK the amount of testing is limited only in sense that you can have one =
run
for one pull request at the time and in order to create a pull request you
need to have a Fedora account, but you don't have to be a packager  -
