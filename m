You are iterating faster than I can review the patches ;)  Please
don't misunderstand, I'm very happy you're contributing to the
notebook; I was hoping people would get involved and I'm glad to see
that is happening.

That said, while it is true that there are a few objects that are
initially assigned the "kernel" isid, those should gain proper labels
as they complete the initialization process, unless of course they are
actually owned by the kernel.  Which brings me to the next point, some
objects are legitimately owned by the kernel, the fact that they are
labeled with the "kernel" isid is intentional.  The same holds true
for the "kernel" isid as a subject label, in cases where you see the
"kernel" isid as a subject, it is actually the kernel acting on
something.
