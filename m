I'm hoping my last email better explains why we only really need
security_bpf_token_cmd() and security_bpf_token_capable() as opposed
to the full list of security_bpf_token_XXX().  If not, please let me
know and I'll try to do a better job explaining my reasoning :)

One thing I didn't discuss in my last email was why there is value in
having both security_bpf_token_{cmd,capable}() as well as
security_bpf_prog_load(); I'll try to do that below.

As we talked about previously, the reason for having
security_bpf_prog_load() is to provide a token-aware version of
security_bpf().  Currently the LSMs enforce their access controls
around BPF commands using the security_bpf() hook which is
unfortunately well before we have access to the BPF token.  If we want
to be able to take the BPF token into account we need to have a hook
placed after the token is retrieved and validated, hence the
security_bpf_prog_load() hook.  In a kernel that provides BPF tokens,
I would expect that LSMs would use security_bpf() to control access to
BPF operations where a token is not a concern, and new token-aware
security_bpf_OPERATION() hooks when the LSM needs to consider the BPF
token.

With the understanding that security_bpf_prog_load() is essentially a
token-aware version of security_bpf(), I'm hopeful that you can begin
to understand that it  serves a different purpose than
security_bpf_token_{cmd,capable}().  The simple answer is that
security_bpf_token_cmd() applies to more than just BPF_PROG_LOAD, but
the better answer is that it has the ability to impact more than just
the LSM authorization decision.  Hooking the LSM into the
bpf_token_allow_cmd() function allows the LSM to authorize the
individual command overrides independent of the command specific LSM
hook, if one exists.  The security_bpf_token_cmd() hook can allow or
disallow the use of a token for all aspects of a specific BPF
operation including all of the token related logic outside of the LSM,
something the security_bpf_prog_load() hook could never do.

I'm hoping that makes sense :)
