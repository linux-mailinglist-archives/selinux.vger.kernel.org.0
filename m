Unspecified or invalid SELINUX defaults to enforce =3D 0. I guess it could
help administrators during initial selinux setup - the system would boot
even with a typo.

`enforcing=3D1` on the kernel command line overrides value set
in config file (in this case it is not set). If SELINUXTYPE is valid,
the policy is loaded and systemd boots. If it's invalid, the systemd
freeze, see bellow.

If systemd can't load policy it logs the problem and freeze in
enforcing. The result of selinux_init_load_policy is ignored in
permissive and systemd continue with boot, see bellow.

                if (enforce > 0) {
                        if (!initialized)
                                return log_emergency_errno(SYNTHETIC_ERRNO(=
EIO),
                                                           "Failed to load =
SELinux policy.");

                        log_warning("Failed to load new SELinux policy. Con=
tinuing with old policy.");
                } else
                        log_debug("Unable to load SELinux policy. Ignoring.=
");
        }

My understanding is that internally in kernel is SELinux enabled during
build process and it considers SELinux to be enabled unless selinux=3D0 is
used on kernel command line.

For userspace it's propagated as availability of /sys/fs/selinux.

AFAIK whether /sys/fs/selinux is mounted or not doesn't say anything
about status of SELinux inside kernel. It's just used as simple
indicator for userspace whether it can use SELinux API or not.
