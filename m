By the way, there also needs to be a way to skip this check or to
configure which pkg-config file is selected when building for example
in a continuous-integration environment. For example I got a failure
in https://circleci.com/gh/fishilico/selinux/438 ("libsepol is
required to be version 3.0 or higher, got: 2.8") because libsepol 2.8
is installed system-wide while libsepol from git is being used
(because there is a -L flag in LDFLAGS). A possible way to dead with
this would be to modify an environment variable such as
PKG_CONFIG_PATH in the root Makefile (in block "ifneq ($(DESTDIR),)").

Thanks,
Nicolas
