Inclusion into upstream is far from the goal.

There always is LSM module which is not enabled in pre-built distribution kernels.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=542986

Even if source code is already available in distribution kernels, as long as
distribution refuses to include into pre-built distribution kernels, it is no
different from the out-of-tree LSM.

The user/developer has to rebuild the whole distribution kernels is an unacceptable
barrier.

Not only for preserving the level of distribution support. But also for
allowing immediate updates whenever distribution kernels are updated, and
allowing out of kernel modules (e.g. from AntiVirus, hardware vendors) to be
loaded into pre-built distribution kernels (instead of user/developer rebuilt
distribution kernels).

I know it, especially Red Hat is strict regarding that. Red Hat does not provide
support for rebuilt kernels even with zero changes (e.g. same kernel source code,
same kernel configuration).

Some hardware vendors provide support for their device drivers when used with
RHEL kernel but does not provide support when used with CentOS kernel (not
CentOS Stream), despite there is effectively no difference. Being able to
continue using pre-built distribution kernels is a fatal requirement for users.

That's not a big problem. Loadable LSM modules will be updated as the kernel
interfaces change.

But the combination of "the kernel interfaces does not legally allow loadable LSM modules"
and "distributors do not enable LSMs already available in upstream kernels" and "it is
becoming increasingly difficult for people to find time to review potential new LSMs" and
"it is difficult for users/developers to continue rebuilding distributor kernels only for
enabling LSMs" indicates there is no space for LSMs which are not enabled in pre-built
distribution kernels to survive; it is tantamount to a death sentence.
Legally allowing loadable LSM modules is an answer to current situation.

Unfortunately, that's an impossible request for me. I worked at a support center
for three years, and I found (from e.g. sosreport) that no system enabled SELinux.
Since I already left the support center, I'm no longer in a position who can
collect statistic data.

In know-how manuals developed by the support center, disabling SELinux is the
first action after installation, and people using the support center follow it.
(I personally feel that using SELinux with targeted policy is possible. But
they hate troubles caused by unwanted functionality. And they can't afford
keeping SELinux enabled because nobody can adjust policy for their servers.
If troubles caused by SELinux happen, even I won't be able to provide support
because I'm not in a position to understand and manage the details/usage of
their servers.)

You might wonder how they are protecting their servers without SELinux.
It is a mystery.

But I if recall the days at the support center, I seldom saw servers which
directly face the Internet. Maybe they are using security appliance for servers
facing the Internet, and using RHEL for servers in already secured environment.

Then, the need to enable SELinux remains still low sounds realistic.
For example, telnet and ftp are used even nowadays in some systems.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1853102
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1914536

But again, I'm not in a position for collecting statistic data.

Sure, there are systems where SELinux is the only choice.
But surely there are systems where SELinux is not the only choice.

But due to the above-mentioned death sentence, we currently can't allow
users/developers to use different LSMs which have different goals,
different use cases, and different user groups (markets). Very bad...
