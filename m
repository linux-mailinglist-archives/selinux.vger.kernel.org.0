Subject: [SELinux-notebook PATCH] adds CIL policy with makefile
Date:   Thu, 16 Jul 2020 12:08:51 +0200

This example CIL policy takes a different approach:

1. Leverages CIL
2. Installs using semodule to make it tunable at runtime (but you can obviously also use secilc to build a monolithic version and deploy that)
3. Makes few assumptions about variables
4. Leverages handleunknown allow and declares least required access vectors so that you can pick and choose which access vectors you want to use and ignore the remainder
5. Leverages unlabeled and file ISID and makes no assumptions about any volatile filesystems you may or may not use
6. As small and simple as reasonably possible, heavily documented
7. Modern, Requires SELinux 3.1

+There is another CIL policy in the notebook examples called
+"cil-policy" that takes a slightly different approach where the goal
+is to keep the policy as simple as possible. It requires `semodule`,
+Linux 5.7, SELinux 3.1 and can be installed by executing
+`make install`. It leverages some modern SELinux features, most
+notably where the requirement for ordered security classes is lifted.
+With this you are no longer expected to be aware of all the access
+vectors managed by Linux in order to align your security class
+declarations with the order in which they are declared in the kernel.
+A module store is created by `semodule` to give easy access to the
+source and that allows for full control over the policy.

+# CIL policy from scratch that is mutable at runtime
+
+This example demonstrates an alternative approach to implementing a
+first iteration of a CIL policy from scratch. The main idea is to
+create a policy that is as small as reasonably possible, and to
+install that by using `semodule`. This will provide you with bare
+miminums to get you started in enforcing mode.
+
+To achieve this there are two key features leveraged. The
+`handleunknown` statement, the `unlabeled` and `file` initial
+security identifiers. By allowing unknown access vectors by default we
+can reduce the amount of classes and access vector permission
+declarations needed to get started. This was only recently made
+possible by lifting the requirement to order classes. Requiring
+classes to be ordered implies that the classes are declared, thus it
+requires that you know what classes are managed by Linux. Now we only
+have to be aware of, and declare, a small number of classes and a few
+permissions to get started. All the remaining unknown access vectors
+will be reported to us by SELinux via the kernel ring buffer, it is
+just a matter of looking at `dmesg` to see which access vectors are
+managed by Linux but are unknown to the policy, and then to address
+those in the policy as we go along. You can generally pick and choose
+which access vectors you want to use to achieve your access control
+requirements and you can imply ignore any access vectors that you do
+not need.
+
+The `unlabeled` initial security identifier is used to associate a
+specified context with entities that have their existing context
+invalidated. The `file` initial security identifier is used to
+associate a context with objects that have no labels. This
+functionality can be taken advantage of to reduce the work needed to
+get a working first iteration of the policy that we can then build
+upon. Initial security identifier associated contexts are associated
+with entities in memory. This means that effectively we do not have
+to worry about persistent labels in our first iteration. We can
+address labeling requirements as a first next step to get going.
+
+By using `semodule` we create a module store that we can use to
+manage policy at runtime and all the source policy is
+readily accessible through the store. Some changes might require
+reboot in some scenarios. You can effectively switch to cil-policy at
+runtime in enforcing mode if your system was already enforcing a
+policy before. Otherwise you might have to reboot to load initial
+policy.
+
+This repository comes with a heavily commented CIL module and a make
+file that addresses installation. The make file does make some
+assumptions that are relatively safe but if something breaks, you get
+to keep the pieces. This example requires Linux 5.7 and SELinux 3.1
+because it omits initial sid context specifications for unused
+initial security identifiers.
+
+## Switching to cil-policy from a another policy
+
+1. make install
+2. sed -i 's/SELINUXTYPE=.*/SELINUXTYPE=cil-policy/' /etc/selinux/config
+3. semodule -B
+
+Your first step to actually leverage cil-policy will likely be to
+enable labeling support for your non-volatile filesystems, and to
+apply labels according to the file context specifications defined in
+the policy.
+
+For example if you use `ext4` filesystems:
+
+1. echo '(fsuse xattr "ext4" (sys.id sys.role sys.isid ((s0)(s0))))' > myfs.cil
+2. semodule -i myfs.cil
+3. fixfiles onboot && reboot
+
+Use your favorite text editor to write policy in [Common Intermediate Language](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/master/secilc/docs/README.md),
+manage it with `semodule`, and analyze it with `setools`.
