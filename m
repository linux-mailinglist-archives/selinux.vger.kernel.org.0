Yes. And I think class is good split point. But I think it will require
a few layers, but a is mostly data driven so I think it might be hard
to do it compile time.  I think a hybrid might be possible,
but it then we need some ugly part with a other separator than =,
or some escape seq to separate.

sort of "generc1=X generic2=Y variable1^x variable2^y" or

"generc1=X generic2=Y leftover=[variable1=x variable2=y]"

If there was a formal parameter tree we could maybe do some
generated printer. I don't think there are one, maybe Paul Moore or Stephen Smalley
can verify that.
