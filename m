I'm not "that" concerned about how it's done I'd just like to see
it fixed whether it's how I think it should be done or not.

I think there was a suggestion of using function naming indicate
the different requirement, I think it was along the lines of
kern_write_nosec(), but if that approach is used the nosec is
misleading too, I'd prefer something like kern_write_internal()
to indicate clearly it's meant to cater for internal use.

But whatever, I'm keen to see what you recommend.
