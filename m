So, options would appear to be:
1) Drop the usage of avc_using_threads altogether, i.e. even if the
caller provided a thread callback, don't create another thread and
just call selinux_status_updated() on every avc_has_perm_noaudit()
unless avc_app_main_loop is set.  Rationale: dbus-daemon was only
using threads to avoid the overhead of avc_netlink_check_nb() on every
avc_has_perm_noaudit() call, and we've eliminated that via use of
sestatus, hence we don't need to create a separate thread at all.
-or-
2) If using threads, then create the netlink socket during avc_init
and keep using the netlink loop for the thread.  This preserves the
blocking behavior.

#1 seems more optimal to me and gets rid of threading for dbus-daemon,
which was something they didn't like anyway.
