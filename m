The problem you would quickly run into is that you always need
exceptions in any MLS policy, e.g. files that need to be readable
and/or writable in violation of the normal MLS restrictions and
processes that need to be exempted from them.  The way you do that in
SELinux is to use different TE types and domains and provide OR
clauses in the MLS constraints to exempt them.  So I doubt you truly
want to disable RBAC/TE altogether.  What you could do is to reduce
the policy to just the minimal set of domains and types needed to
support those distinctions and leave most things labeled with the same
domain/type.

If using refpolicy, you want to build with TYPE=mls rather than mcs if
you truly want MLS-style enforcement.  MCS in contrast is opt-in and
only applied to specific domains/types, not to most processes.  In
Fedora/RHEL, you want the -mls policy rather than the default targeted
policy.

Alternatively, you could create your own policy from scratch rather
than using refpolicy.  scripts/selinux/mdp will generate a relatively
minimalist policy for your kernel but then it is up to you to turn it
into something real.  You'd need to modify the stub MLS constraints it
generates, either replacing them with those from refpolicy or writing
your own.

And then there is the option of using another security module or
rolling your own if none of the above works for you.
