Yes, I personally think it is better way to explain the network access controls.

I'm not entirely clear on the question, but both the netif/node
ingress and egress controls fall into the packet layer.

My apologies, using the *existing* terminology ...

I guess this is another problem with the "internal" vs "external"
approach to the current text.  I prefer to think in terms of how the
access controls are structured, and as far as SELinux is concerned it
only has to worry about calling the general NetLabel APIs; it doesn't
matter if CIPSO, CALIPSO, or the static/fallback labeling is
concerned, it's all the same.

Things get more complicated if you start digging into individual
protocols.  Look at the different CIPSO tag types, vs the tagless
approach taken in CALIPSO.  Not to mention the way labeled IPsec
works; people get enamored by the encryption/authentication aspects,
but it's really a very poor fit for SELinux.  There are a number of
problems caused by the fact that labeled IPsec is an implicit labeling
mechanism that labels SAs and not packets, there are issues around
ensuring all of the labels have the same (or close enough) meaning on
both systems, and it is likely only to ever work between the SELinux
systems.
