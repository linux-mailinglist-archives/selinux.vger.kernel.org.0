Tyler - I am not sure why AppArmor state\policy would be ignored when 
both SELinux and AppArmor are enabled. Could you please clarify?

When both the security modules are enabled, IMA policy validator would 
look like below:

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX) ||
     IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR)) &&
     strcmp(args[0].from, "LSM_STATE") == 0)
                 entry->func = LSM_STATE;

Similar one for LSM_POLICY validation.

Both SELinux and AppArmor can call ima_measure_lsm_state() and 
ima_measure_lsm_policy() to measure state and policy respectively.

I don't think we should go the route of defining IMA hooks per security 
module (i.e., SELINUX_STATE, APPARMOR_STATE, SELINUX_POLICY, etc.) 
Instead keep the hook generic that any SM could use - which is what I 
have tried to address in this patch series.

Good point - if other SMs have data besides state and policy, we can 
define IMA hooks to measure that as well.

But I still think it is not the right approach to call this 
SELINUX_STATE and SELINUX_POLICY - it will lead to unnecessary code 
duplication in IMA as more SMs are onboarded, in my opinion. Correct me 
if I am wrong.
