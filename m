Originally introduced here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1072714025.845.92.camel@moss-spartans.epoch.ncsc.mil/

The threat scenario is one where a process lowers its limit prior to a
domain-changing execve() in order to induce a failure in the new
program that leads to a security vulnerability.  Specific motivating
example:
https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/Pine.LNX.4.33.0306060554430.10200-300000@vox.rv.nailabs.com/

That said, I'm not sure that this check (or rlimitinh) are effectively
leveraged in Linux (or Android) today, so it may be that it isn't
providing practical benefit.  Some analysis perhaps of existing
policies and past CVEs (e.g. would/could it have made a difference)
might be interesting.
