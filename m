 **Figure 1** shows a high level diagram of the SELinux core components that
 manage enforcement of the policy and comprise of the following:
 
-1.  A [**Subjects**](subjects.md#subjects) that must be present to cause an action
-    to be taken by an [**Objects**](objects.md#objects) (such as read a file as
-    information only flows when a subject is involved).
-2.  An Object Manager that knows the actions required of the particular
-    resource (such as a file) and can enforce those actions (i.e. allow
-    it to write to a file if permitted by the policy).
-3.  A Security Server that makes decisions regarding the subjects rights
-    to perform the requested action on the object, based on the security
-    policy rules.
-4.  A Security Policy that describes the rules using the SELinux
-    [**Kernel Policy Language**](kernel_policy_language.md#kernel-policy-language)).
-5.  An Access Vector Cache (AVC) that improves system performance by
-    caching security server decisions.

 This diagram will be referenced a number of times to explain areas of
 SELinux, therefore starting from the bottom:
 
-1.  In the current implementation of SELinux the security server is
-    embedded in the kernel with the policy being loaded from userspace via a
-    series of functions contained in the **libselinux** library (see
-    [**SELinux Userspace Libraries**](userspace_libraries.md#selinux-userspace-libraries) for details).
-
-    The object managers (OM) and access vector cache (AVC) can reside in:
-
--   **kernel space** - These object manages are for the kernel services such
-as files, directory, socket, IPC etc. and are provided by hooks into the
-SELinux sub-system via the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework (shown
-as LSM Hooks in ) that is discussed in the
-[**Linux Security Module and SELinux**](lsm_selinux.md#linux-security-module-and-selinux)
- section. The SELinux kernel AVC service is used to cache the security servers
-response to the kernel based object managers thus speeding up access decisions
-should the same request be asked in future.
-
--   **userspace** - These object managers are provided with the application
-    or service that requires support for MAC and are known as
-    'SELinux-aware' applications or services. Examples of these are:
-    X-Windows, D-bus messaging (used by the Gnome desktop), PostgreSQL
-    database, Name Service Cache Daemon (*nscd*), and the GNU / Linux passwd
-    command. Generally, these OMs use the AVC services built into the
-    SELinux library (libselinux), however they could, if required supply
-    their own AVC or not use an AVC at all (see
-    [**Implementing SELinux-aware Applications**](implementing_seaware_apps.md#implementing-selinux-aware-applications) for details).
-
-2.  The SELinux security policy (right hand side of **Figure 2**) and its
-supporting configuration files are contained in the /etc/selinux directory.
-This directory contains the main SELinux configuration file *config* that has
-the name of the policy to be loaded (via the *SELINUXTYPE* entry) and the initial
-enforcement mode<a href="#fnc1" class="footnote-ref" id="fncor1"><sup>1</sup></a>
-of the policy at load time (via the *SELINUX* entry).
-The /etc/selinux/*&lt;SELINUXTYPE&gt;* directories
-contain policies that can be activated along with their configuration
-files (e.g. '*SELINUXTYPE=targeted*' will have its policy and associated
-configuration files located at */etc/selinux/targeted*). All known
-configuration files are shown in the
-[**SELinux Configuration Files**](configuration_files.md#selinux-configuration-files)
-sections.
-
-3.  SELinux supports a 'modular policy', this means that a policy does not
-have to be one large source policy but can be built from modules. A
-modular policy consists of a base policy that contains the mandatory
-information (such as object classes, permissions etc.), and zero or more
-policy modules where generally each supports a particular application or
-service. These modules are compiled, linked, and held in a 'policy
-store' where they can be built into a binary format that is then loaded
-into the security server (in the diagram the binary policy is located at
-*/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30*). The types of policy and their
-construction are covered in the
-[**Types of SELinux Policy**](types_of_policy.md#types-of-selinux-policy)
-section.
-
-4.  To be able to build the policy in the first place, policy source is
-required (top left hand side of **Figure 2**). This can be supplied in three
-basic ways:
-
--  as source code written using the
-[**Kernel Policy Language**](kernel_policy_language.md#kernel-policy-language),
-however it is not recommended for large policy developments.
--  using the **Reference Policy** that has high
-level macros to define policy rules. This is the standard way
-policies are now built for SELinux distributions such as Red Hat
-and Debian and is discussed in the
-[**The Reference Policy**](reference_policy.md#the-reference-policy)
-section. Note that SE for Android also uses high level macros to define
-policy rules.
