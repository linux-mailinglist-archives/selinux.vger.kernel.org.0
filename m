Don't worry about it, sure there is a bit more code, but I think it's
a better approach than all of the alternatives we've attempted.  I'd
rather have "better" than a hack ;)

That's sounds reasonable to me.  Our policy in LSM land is that you
should provide at least one LSM implementation when adding a new hook
(the BPF LSM doesn't count due to it's rather unique approach), so if
you can provide a SELinux implementation that should meet that
requirement.  I'm also not sure that any of the other LSMs currently
claim support for MPTCP.

The LSM has also seen a lot of renewed activity lately.  However, I
think the deciding factor is where the bulk of the code will live, and
with the vast majority of the code expected under security/, I think
it makes sense to merge this via the LSM tree.  My general policy for
the LSM tree is to either base your patches of Linus' tree or the
lsm/next branch and I'll handle whatever merge conflicts arise at the
time of merging.

For reference, the current LSM tree can be found here:
