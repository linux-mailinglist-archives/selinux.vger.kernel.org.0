I was thinking I'd create an app type, port type, socket
type and a type transition:
type a_t;
type a_port_t;
type a_sock_t
type_transition init_t a_port_t:tcp_socket a_socket_t;

I'd use semanage or cil to set the port type.
semanage port -a -p tcp -t a_port_t XXXX
or:
portcon ...

Then when systemd is creating the socket for the activated service it
would lookup the port type in policy and call security_compute_create
passing in systemds context, the port context and tcp_socket class
which would return an a_socket_t context to be used in the
setsockcreatecon call.
