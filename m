Yes, I know it is in the net tree, that is how it made its way into
linux-next.  I wouldn't have merged it yet, and if not me who else
would have merged it beside the netdev folks?

Am I misunderstanding your comment?

Like many kernel trees the default/main branch for the SELinux tree
doesn't contain anything useful, for the SELinux tree (and audit for
that matter) it is basically just the most recent major/minor tag from
Linus tree with a single tree specific README.md file patch so that
the GitHub mirror has a pretty landing page and a canonical reference
for how the tree is maintained.

* https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel

The general approach to the SELinux tree, as documented in the
README.md, is to do all of the linux-next work in the selinux/next
branch with the stable work happening in the selinux/stable-X.Y
branches.

FWIW, once we've resolved things I would be happy to have the patchset
live in the SELinux tree as opposed to the netdev tree.
