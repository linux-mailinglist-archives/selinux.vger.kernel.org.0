I will rework on the definition in the next iteration.
Meanwhile, if you have any feedback on what can we add to the
definition, that would help is.

The goal of this series is to introduce the IMA hook
measure_critical_data() and the necessary policies to use it; and
illustrate that use with one example (SELinux). It is not scalable to 
identify and update all the critical data sources to use the proposed
module at once.

A piecemeal approach to add more critical data measurement in subsequent
patches would be easy to implement and review.

Please let me know if you have more thoughts on this. (what critical
data you think would be useful to measure etc.)
