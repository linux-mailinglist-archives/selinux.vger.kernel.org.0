This is how EAUG could ask if RWX is okay. If an enclave is internally doing=
 dynamic loading, the it will need a heap page with maxperm =3D RWX.  (If it=
=E2=80=99s well designed, it will make it RW and then RX, either by changing=
 SECINFO or by asking the host to mprotect() it, but it still needs the over=
all RWX mask.).

Also, do real SGX1 enclave formats have BSS? If so, then either we need an i=
octl or load zeros or user code is going to load from /dev/zero or just from=
 the heap, but the LSM is going to play better with an ioctl, I suspect :)

The benefit of putting it on .sigstruct is that it can be per-enclave.

As I understand it from Fedora packaging, the way this works on distros is g=
enerally that a package will include some files and their associated labels,=
 and, if the package needs EXECMOD, then the files are labeled with EXECMOD a=
nd the author of the relevant code might get a dirty look.

This could translate to the author of an exclave that needs RWX regions gett=
ing a dirty look without leaking this permission into other enclaves.

(In my opinion, the dirty looks are actually the best security benefit of th=
e entire concept of LSMs making RWX difficult.  A sufficiently creative atta=
cker can almost always bypass W^X restrictions once they=E2=80=99ve pwned yo=
u, but W^X makes it harder to pwn you in the first place, and SELinux makes i=
t really obvious when packaging a program that doesn=E2=80=99t respect W^X. =
 The upshot is that a lot of programs got fixed.)=
