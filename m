A good long-term solution to this would likely be to add a small
wrapper function for SELinux's security_audit_rule_match() hook (e.g.
loop on selinux_audit_rule_match() when ESTALE is returned) so that
callers wouldn't need to worry about this, but I first want to make
sure that is the problem.  If that *is* the problem, I can draft up a
SELinux patch pretty quick.
