The function txopt_get() in include/net/ipv6.h uses something quite
similar.  By convention, rcu_pointer_handoff() is (sometimes) used to
indicate that the pointer is now protected by something other than RCU,
as shown in that function.  And grepping for rcu_pointer_handoff()
can find you a few more.
