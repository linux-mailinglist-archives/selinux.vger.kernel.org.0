The default when invoking make is to build and link against the normal
search paths,
so if your building and linking against something non-standard by
modifying the various
environment flags to manipulate things like -,  etc, the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH would be
what you would also modify. If you add to the env variable, that dir
is searched first.

I'm also noticing our PC requires field is missing libaudit, ie:
requires.private audit

It looks like something like this when building the PC file is what we need=
:
pkg-config --print-errors ./src/libsemanage.pc << use the local file

This would also provide validation to our PC file before release.
