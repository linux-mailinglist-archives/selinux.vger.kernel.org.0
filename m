Okay I dont think you mentioned that before

I dont think you mentioned this before and I think you also didnt
mention that you had userdomain associates with it.

That is wrong

Yes but that is wrong

Yes the computation does not cause any logging

Yes but the above is not right, and so those errors are expected.

It helps if you post your full policy related to this and also the output
of the following:

seinfo -xuCDTml_high2local_u
seinfo -xrCDTml_high2local_r
seinfo -xtxferHigh2Local_t

That shouldnt matter, but it helps if you post the full policy rather
than snippets.

also there are some tools that you can use to verify if a specified
context can be reached.

getconlist:
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/master/libselinux/utils/getconlist.c
getdefaultcon:
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/master/libselinux/utils/getdefaultcon.c

There is also a boolean that might affect things (but speculation
without a closer look at your policy):

ssh_sysadm_login

see if setting that to on helps
