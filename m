One alternative would be to move the mutex from selinux_fs_info to
selinux_state, at which point the mutex would already be accessible to
the security server code through the state parameters.  This also
makes sense from the perspective that the mutex is already used to
synchronize not only selinuxfs-private state (e.g. pending bools) but
also policy changes.  I think this will be needed anyway for the
patches to measure SELinux state because that call chain does not go
through selinuxfs and thus has no access to selinux_fs_info.

I don't suppose you have editor settings to help automate this?
