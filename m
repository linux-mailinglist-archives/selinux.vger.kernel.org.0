We don't actually store SECCLASS_FD in any security blobs currently
(i.e. there is no sclass field in the file_security_struct); we just
always check against SECCLASS_FD in file_has_perm(),
selinux_binder_transfer_file(), ioctl_has_perm(),
selinux_kernel_module_from_file(). As you note, we don't have a way of
knowing what kind of fd it is at those points so we would need to
somehow pass that information to selinux_file_alloc_security() and
save the class at that time, or otherwise introduce new hooks.

There are three approaches that could be taken here:
1. Introduce new permissions on the existing class, as proposed by Chris,
2. Introduce new classes, as you proposed,
3. Label different kinds of fds via type_transitions or similar so
that we can distinguish them by type in policy rather than needing
separate permissions or classes.

We've used all three approaches in the past for different kinds of
checks so it is more a question of what is optimal for this use case.
The last one is the heaviest approach since it imposes extra overhead
upon allocation/labeling that doesn't currently exist for fds.

All that said, I am not entirely sure how useful the current fd use
permission is, nor how useful these finer-grained checks will be.
Fedora policy by default allows every domain to use every other
domain's fds (controllable via domain_fd_use boolean, default is
true). Android I think is more selective.
