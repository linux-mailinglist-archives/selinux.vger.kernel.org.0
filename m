Er... sorry, I forgot to document it clearly in the e-mails, but the
usage didn't actually drop between the last two versions (it actually
increased by ~36 KB). It's just that In the previous version I
"measured" the memory usage just by looking at the total memory usage
reported by top, which is however fluctuating a lot and I was
apparently just measuring noise... For this patch I actually printk'd
the sizes of the tables exactly (since that's the only thing this
patch touches) and this showed these much smaller numbers. So please
disregard the 1-2 MB from the previous patch versions - they were
bogus.
