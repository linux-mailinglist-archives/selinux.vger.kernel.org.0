Hi Konstantin,

You might want to extend this test to the LSM list as well.  I'm
refraining from CC'ing them on this email because I don't want to
spoil your beta test rollout, but I think it would be a good thing to
do.

Speaking as the person who merges patches for both the SELinux and
audit kernel subsystems, I look at every patch I merge; I don't
blindly merge patches (even from certain "trusted" individuals).
Simply put, I've always considered that to be part of the job.  While
the patch attestation could provide some assurance about who created
the patch (assuming a reasonable web-of-trust), and that it hadn't
been tampered with, I feel it is more important to review correctness
than it is to guarantee provenance.  If you ever develop a tool which
can help with the correctness part, I'll gladly jump to the front of
the line to test that one! ;)

Having said that, I'm happy to see work going into tools like this,
and at some point I'll look into adding it into my workflow for an
extra level of safety (although I'm on the fence about making it
mandatory for submissions).  Sorry to disappoint, but I'm probably not
the best test monkey right now.
