How prevalent are these crashes?

This also only happens when disabling SELinux at runtime, yes?
Something we've advised against for some time now and are working to
eliminate?  Let's just get rid of the runtime disable *soon*, and if
we need a stop-gap fix let's just go with the hook reordering since
that seems to minimize the impact, if not resolve it.

I'm not going to comment on the stacking changes.
