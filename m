Hello,
About performance issues, the current implementation of
ebitmap_cardinality() is quadratic:

for (i=ebitmap_startbit(e1); i < ebitmap_length(e1); i++)
    if (ebitmap_get_bit(e1, i))
        count++;

... because ebitmap_get_bit() browse the bitmap:

while (n && (n->startbit <= bit)) {
   if ((n->startbit + MAPSIZE) > bit) {
      /*... */

A few years ago, I tried modifying this function to make it linear in
the bitmap size:

unsigned int ebitmap_cardinality(ebitmap_t *e1)
{
    unsigned int count = 0;
    ebitmap_node_t *n;

   for (n = e1->node; n; n = n->next) {
        count += __builtin_popcountll(n->map);
    }
    return count;
}

... but never actually sent a patch for this, because I wanted to
assess how __builtin_popcountll() was supported by several compilers
beforehand. Would this be helpful to gain even more performance gain?

Cheers,
Nicolas
