I tried doing the merge on my own here [1], you can use it as a sanity
check if we came to the same/similar result. I based it off your
existing next-queue, which contains only Jeff's patch at the time of
writing. I only build-tested it so far.

Note that there are two whitespace cleanups included in the string
cache commit that I intuitively did while resolving the merge
conflicts. You might want to move those to the first commit or just
ignore them.
