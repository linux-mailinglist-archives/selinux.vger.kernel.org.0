Actually, if we used ima-ng template for selinux-policy-hash, then
instead of needing to hash the policy
first and passing the hash to IMA, we could just pass the policy as
the buffer and IMA would take care of the hashing, right?
And we only need to use ima-buf for the selinux-state if we want the
measurement list to include the string value that
was hashed; if we just want to compare against a known-good, it would
suffice to use ima-ng for it as well, right?
