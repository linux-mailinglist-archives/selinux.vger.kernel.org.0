You can also use checkpolicy to turn the binary back into a
policy.conf or CIL policy (although it won't be a valid CIL policy
because of "." in the names -- something I am hoping to correct in the
near future.)

It is the intended behaviour. We have tried to make the behavior as
least surprising and as flexible as possible.

It is not a change as much as the documentation is wrong and needs to
be fixed. Again, this ordering seemed to us as the least surprising.
Obviously, this was our opinion and good arguments can be made for
different behavior.

Really, this behavior does not come up very often. Unless blocks are
being used there is little reason to put a declaration in a macro,
since the type should only be declared once.

The CIL Wiki is out of date and should not be considered as CIL
documentation at this point.

Merging macros was an idea during development, but it seemed to cause
more problems than it could solve.

What should happen is that either a warning or an error is given about
duplicate macro names. This is something that I plan on tackling soon.
It is also a problem for blocks and optionals.

As I mentioned above, the CIL Wiki should not be used and I consider
the lack of at least a warning to be a bug.

All macro calls are expanded before any name resolution occurs. By
expanded I mean all the rules from the macro are copied into a block
under the call.

The ordering of processing: tunableif, in, blockinherit, macro calls,
aliases, ordering statements, and then name resolution in rules.

This is the behavior that is intended. For a long time, macros in
SELinux were just m4 macros, so we did not want to completely get away
from macros acting just as text expansion.

This is intentional, but I cannot remember why we went that way and I
am not sure that I like the behavior at all.

Thanks for your questions. I mostly want the behavior to be consistent
and as unsurprising as possible. Not many people have explored how all
of this works, so I would not be surprised if there were some strange
behaviors.
