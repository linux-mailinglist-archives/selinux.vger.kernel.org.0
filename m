I don't see how where the cred reference live will have any impact,
you still need to get and drop references which will have an impact.
There will always be something.

I'm going to skip over the Landlock contribution as that isn't part of
the patchset and to the best of my knowledge that is still a work in
progress and not finalized.

You also forgot to add in the cost of the fown_struct->cred pointer.

I noticed you chose to do your count in bits, likely to make the
numbers look bigger (which is fair), I'm going to do my count in bytes
;) ... So we've got four bytes removed from the SELinux blob, and
eight bytes from the Smack blob, but we add back in another eight
bytes for the new cred pointer, making a net benefit of only four
bytes for each open file.  Considering my concerns around the loss of
flexibility at the LSM layer I don't see this as a worthwhile
tradeoff.

I don't know, you were talking about making sure the VFS semantics are
visible to the LSM and I was simply suggesting that the existing hooks
do that too.  To be honest, whatever point you are trying to make here
isn't very clear to me.

I agree that the security_file_set_owner() hook needs to be moved.  I
disagree about the value in shifting the LSM framework over to a cred
reference which effectively abandons the existing hook.  My preference
would be to preserve the flexibility of the hook, but move it to the
protected lock location, and continue to leverage the file->f_security
blob as needed for any LSM state.
