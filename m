Fair point.  It's reflected in USER_MAC_POLICY_LOAD instead of MAC_POLICY_LOAD, 
as an example.

At this point we already audited success for the setenforce operation.  Wouldn't 
it be confusing to have a op=setenforce res=1 and then immediately op=setenforce 
res=0?

I'm not deeply familiar with the AVC intricacies.  If the cache fails to clear, 
then there could be wrong cache entries, no?  If so, I would argue that it's 
worthy of an audit.  If not, then I agree that it's not auditable.

Perhaps the question is: are any of SELINUX_ERROR actually auditable?  If so, it 
would seem the answer is to either add another log level for auditable errors. 
If not, then the few UAVC users that audit SELINUX_ERROR need to be fixed. 
Alternatively we could change these non-auditable SELINUX_ERRORs to 
SELINUX_WARNING, since admins can't do much about these in most (all?) cases.


Maybe we should add a log callback function to libselinux that UAVC users could 
optionally use.  It would audit where appropriate and otherwise syslog/stderr 
the message.  That would provide an upgrade path for consistent auditing while 
still allowing UAVC users the option to handle the log callback another way when 
desired.  A another option would be to introduce a new callback specifically for 
auditing.
