The use-case for this is livecd/usb creation. For example creating an
MLS livecd/usb on a non-MLS host.

I also hit this issue on policy-developement as I am also a user of the
mkosi tool that is referenced in the issue.

mkosi is a tool that can build a source and boot an image using that
source. If I add some module to my policy source tree and I want to test
that in a virtual machine then I would run mkosi on the source.

mkosi is not allowed to use the label that is unknown on the host on the
filesystem. So the file ends up unlabeled in the virtual machine. So
using mkosi for testing policy is not useful unless you run mkosi as
root. Which is fair to be honest. There is quite a bit of functionality
in mkosi that only works if you run it as root.
