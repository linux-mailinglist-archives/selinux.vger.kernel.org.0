I know support is expensive. But distributors are not the only organizations
who provide support. Non-distributors can provide efforts for fixing bugs.
(In fact, I'm debugging problems where distributors would not care/support.)

What certifications require that an LSM must not be loaded as a loadable kernel
module?

I can imagine that certification becomes void if uncertified/extra kernel modules
are loaded. But I can't imagine that ability to load some kernel module (either
LSM or not) is relevant to certification.

Yes. It took me whole 2 years to prove that a timeout problem happening in a RHEL
system using TrendMicro's DeepSecurity is caused by a loadable kernel module used
by DeepSecurity. It is really difficult to analyze problems with closed-source
kernel modules, for I can't guess what is happening from source code.

You can browse how a loadable kernel module (for TrendMicro's ServerProtect) would look like
at https://files.trendmicro.com/products/splx/splx_kernel_module-3.0.1.0024-src.tar.gz .
I'm expecting that such loadable kernel module becomes cleaner by legally allowing
loadable LSM modules.

An interface that allows blocking unwanted loadable kernel module (either LSM or not)
will be e.g. module signature verification. No special switch for LSM is needed.

The "Vendor-A enables module-A" == "Vendor-A provides support for module-A" and
"Vendor-B enables module-B" == "Vendor-B provides support for module-B" rule can
apply to non-SELinux LSMs.
