I think that (dropping the precedence changes) is a good idea at this
point.  Let's focus on the change to services_compute_xperms_drivers()
as I suspect this is the bigger issue.

We really should hear from the Android folks on this as they are
probably the biggest user of the xperms code.  I'm a little surprised
and disappointed that we haven't heard from them yet, but they may be
out of the office at the moment.  I would suggest posting a v2 patch
as you mentioned above and we'll see if we can get the attention of
the Android folks.
