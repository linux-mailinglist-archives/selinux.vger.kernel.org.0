One way to use this trace is to write directly to a memory buffer over a time
period. In the case for Android and I guess in many other embedded cases too
they are moved to be some other machine to be analysed so having them
locked to where it was running also have problems.

So what is the problem we see with the plugin, that we have perms names
that are "unknown" ?
