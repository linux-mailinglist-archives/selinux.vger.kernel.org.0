Oh, sorry, I meant -f, not -F. That is, the user would be given two choices=
:
a) Don't touch /tmp and do the general relabeling immediately. In this
case the user will be warned that /tmp contents may remain incorrectly
labeled.
b) Schedule /tmp resetting + relabeling for next early boot (where the
recursive delete should be safe). In this case the user will be warned
that they need to reboot for anything to happen.

To be fair, the whole fixfiles script is a mess... Feel free to
propose a patch, but my goal right now is just to make it less prone
to unexpected consequences.
