It does raise the question. I, for one, would like to see the
LSM infrastructure move toward being a bit more helpful regarding
things that the various LSMs do that can be done commonly. One
example of this is moving blob allocations out of the individual
modules. Another is the introduction of lsm properties
(struct lsm_prop) to replace the SELinux specific secid model.
When there where five LSMs total, only two to be used at a time,
leaving everything to the individual module was mildly tolerable.
Today we see that there's a heap of waste in data management and
duplicate code when even a base Fedora uses eight at a time.

I don't see this as a matter of taste. I see this as a case where
we can make the LSM infrastructure a little less chaotic.

Stephen does not require this in his SELinux implementation.
Nor did the abandoned Smack namespaces. On the other hand, I
can see where a system with a dynamic security configuration
such as yours might indeed need this.

You've got paradigm conflict developing here. SELinux (for example)
would prefer to make its own decisions regarding "security relevant"
operations. Landlock, which is "unprivileged", ought to be able to
perform its namespace operations without undue interference. While
I generally think that all LSMs ought to integrate with capabilities,
but I have to admit to the status quo.

Bluntly, that's not gonna happen. It would break Smack for one thing.
