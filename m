Ah! Paul! A true pleasure -- and thanks again for all your documentation! I
wouldn't be nearly as far as I am without you. I hope you know how many of
us out here are very grateful for your tireless work, Paul!

Understood on all counts, thank you very much!

Got it. That's super helpful, thanks.

I'm running Debian sid -- which I am fully eyes-open about how stale
and/or actively busted our policy is. I don't think too many people have
MCS configured on their systems, so it's not going to be a huge shock
to me when this is part of the root cause here.

I have a pile of stuff I'm loading in even to get stuff to where I'm at
now, and I think long-term I'll likely try to start agitating on ways to
get Debian's policy a bit more up to date. That's a windmill for another
day, though, I think. Our SELinux maintainers work very hard and
I don't want to add work for them without being able to pitch in.

I've uploaded netlabel-tools to Debian[1] back in October, and I've been
playing a bit with netlabel on my home network (both to get better
at SELinux generally an CIPSO/CALIPSO/NetLabel specifically)
so I can effectively triage/debug issues in Debian.

I know basically no one is in the same boat as me, and I'm OK with that :)

Amazing. Lovely. Thank you! I will be sure to go through this and work
through issues as I find them. Thanks for the pointer, I hadn't found this
yet!

Perfect. Thanks, Paul!
