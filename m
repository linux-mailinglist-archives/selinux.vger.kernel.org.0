Doing it immediately seems like the right thing to do.  So that
the container runtime can keep the umount/remount of selinuxfs
with the unshare, instead of having to defer that until after
a later syscall.

I think this should be done by the SELinux hook.  And I suspect you
do want to require those privs, but I could be wrong.

Hm, that's an interesting problem.

maybe 'unshare' means that an unshare is in progress, and add an
'unshared' which is incremented on every unshare (and never
decremented) for use by the testsuite?
