Thanks for the feedback Mimi. Will do.

Thanks for the feedback Mimi.
We extensively reviewed the patches internally before submitting for
upstream review.
We believed adding an extra tab was necessary so that all the previous
values were aligned with the new one - #define IMA_DATA_SOURCES.
We can certainly revert back to only IMA_DATA_SOURCES to have an extra
tab.

This was also intentional, and was reviewed internally.
The feedback was we should let the consumers of
process_buffer_measurement() decide whether to use the return
value or not. With void, we are not giving them any choice.

Thanks for the pointer. We'll use scripts/Lindent going forward.
