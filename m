The intent behind that description was twofold. One, as you mentioned,
the individual record size being large; and two, multiple large-sized
individual records will eventually bloat the measurement list too.

It can happen in SeLinux case as we discovered. The SeLinux policy
(which can be a few MBs) can change from 'foo', to 'bar', back to 'foo'.
And the requirement from SeLinux is that 'foo' should be measured the
second time too. When 'foo' and 'bar' are large, the individual records
in the ima log will be large, which will also result in measurement list
being bloated.

But I understand your concern with the current wording. I will update 
the patch description accordingly.

The client and the server implementation will go hand in hand. The
client/kernel would know what data is measured as-is
(e.g. KEXEC_CMDLINE), and what data has it’s hash measured
(e.g. SeLinux Policy). And the attestation server would verify data/hash
accordingly.

Just like the data being measured in other cases, the attestation server 
will know what are possible values of the large buffers being measured. 
It will have to maintain the hash of those buffer values.

As mentioned above, the use case for this feature is in-memory loaded 
SeLinux policy, which can be quite large (several MBs) – that's why this 
functionality. The data is meant to be verified by the attestation server.

I will update the patch description to clarify all this.

With the way ima_calc_buffer_hash() is implemented, I was convinced that
the variable duplication was needed. I didn't want to write a helper 
function in order to minimize the unnecessary code churn in p_b_m().
But I will revisit this to see how I can reduce the code and variable 
duplication.

Thanks for the feedback.
