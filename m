To start at the end. I agree that since the decision was already made that it is
probably best to not break compatibility now.

I have difficulty imagining a practical use-case where one might want to resolve
before inheritance, but given the compatibility aspect I think it does
not matter whether I can or cannot imagine a practical use-case. Last
thing I want to do is promote abstracting away any of the flexibility
that defines SELinux.

None of them perfectly describe "same-as-in-but-then-with-inheritance". I
guess closest to that is "within". It is the functionality that matters
most to me.
