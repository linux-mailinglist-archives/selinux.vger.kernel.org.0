What I had in mind was actually to just use
sepol_kernel_policydb_to_cil() to dump the textual CIL into a
temporary file (maybe using tmpfile(3)), and then parse the contents
in Python. The CIL format is really easy to parse (especially in
Python) so a lack of existing functions for that wouldn't be much of
an issue. Yes, this would be a little dirty, but you'd avoid the
trouble of maintaining a stable binary interface between libsepol and
setools.
