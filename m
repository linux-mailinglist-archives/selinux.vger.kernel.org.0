Yes, exactly.  One of my bigger worries about the stacking effort is
that a lot of people have some false assumptions about what it will
actually enable.  Of course that doesn't mean it isn't worth doing,
just that there may be a lot of disappointed people out there.

Most of that is just a matter of writing the code.  Yes, that's going
to be a decent chunk of work, but the idea is relatively
straightforward.  The bit that keeps blocking this in my mind is
handling of the persistent filesystem labels, that's a conceptual
problem we have yet to solve.  The current solution of just creating
more and more (scoped) xattrs isn't going to scale to the level I
believe we are going to need.  I keep toying with the idea of just
punting on it and leaving it up to the container orchestrator to
manage the filesystems; if you want to run a nested SELinux instance
inside a container with dedicated file labels you need your own
filesystem mounted.  Dunno, lots to think about here ...

That makes much more sense, thanks John.
