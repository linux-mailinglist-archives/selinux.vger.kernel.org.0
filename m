I don't use it myself, but I know it's frighteningly popular.

They're going to have to do something, true enough.

I'm using my experience with the "hideous" context format
( "apparmor\0unconfined\0smack\0User\0" ) as a guide. Creating
a "sane" API for returning multiple lsm/context pairs is going
to be tricky. No one wants to require iterative calls to get a
collection of values for example. I've spent the past few years
trying to pound out APIs that are somewhat sane. I don't want to
spend another few years repeating the process for kernel APIs.

That's fine, except that the process here is nowhere near the
beginning. v1 was in June of 2019, and I had posted several unnumbered
versions before then. No one has ever - not once - proposed syscall
interfaces until now. I would be delighted to investigate and include
syscall interfaces for the Complete stacking (SELinux + Smack) work,
as I can see considerably greater need for them there.

I confess to having committed many hideous API sins.

Trivial wrappers to set attributes aren't any cleaner than /proc interfaces.
And in any case, if you've hidden the syscall in a wrapper you can hide the
/proc interfaces in a wrapper as well.

O..K.. then syscalls could be a completely separate project. 
The current work need not be dependent on whatever syscall work is done.

Yes. A syscall is easier for an application to use. A /proc interface
is much easier for a scripted system. The scripts are much more frequently
updated than the C coded services. Some of the services are so rarely and
cautiously updated that expecting them to be modernized is unreasonable.
How many system services use capabilities the way they were designed to
be used?

Just pointing out that the stacking patches aren't that complicated.

Again, just saying the the patches, while extensive, don't do very much

What API are you saying is awful, and how would you improve it?
The sample APIs you proposed wouldn't work as syscalls.

OK, so what interfaces need to be redone? I have been polishing what's
just become a turd for a %^&*(ing long time. I need to know whether it
is something I can address, or whether I just toss the entire thing in
the proverbial bit bucket.

Grumble grumble grumble.
