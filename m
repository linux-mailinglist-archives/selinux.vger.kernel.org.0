Look at it this way, the selinux-testsuite is not doing anything
particularly unusual with respect to talking over IB; if the tests
need that permission it seems reasonable that normal IB users would
also need these permissions.

Once again, the selinux-testsuite is not doing anything particularly
unusual so if we are hitting this it seems reasonable that other users
are hitting this as well.  If you're concerned about granting
CAP_IPC_LOCK you could always put it in a dedicated IB/RDMA refpol
interface as I believe this is just an issue with the IB/RDMA verb
interface involving CQs/QPs and not the underlying IB protocol layer.
Say something like "dev_rw_infiniband_rdma()"* which would call
"dev_rw_infiniband()"* and add the CAP_IPC_LOCK permission.

It would be good to hear Chris' take on this.

* Upstream refpol appears to have shortened the interface to
"dev_rw_infiniband()".
