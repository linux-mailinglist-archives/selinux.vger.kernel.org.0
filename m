I played with this a bit by recompiling the local binary policy with
secilc and then comparing the CIL of both binary policies (I used this
script [1]) and the results are a bit confusing... There is no
difference in result between -X 0 and -X 1 [2] and in both cases it
removes some unused attributes (those are only referenced from
neverallow rules) that were in the original policy
(/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.31 from my Fedora 31 machine),
but not in the one recompiled via checkpolicy -C + secilc... At least
I was able to confirm that secilc -X 2 really removes the attributes
that have only one type and reduces the policy size by a few
kilobytes.

I suspect that the reason for the unremoved attributes in the policy
built by semodule are due to a bug in libsepol: It seems that when it
starts with a cildb that has the neverallow rules in the input policy
+ has disable_neverallow set, it removes the rules but not the
attributes that are used only in them. Only when it reads the policy
again, it identifies these unused attributes (since there are no
longer any neverallow rules in the input) and removes them
unconditionally. It could be something else, but if I'm right then I
think libsepol should be fixed to remove the unused attributes right
away. I don't dare digging into the CIL code to investigate it, though
;)

[2] Okay, this part is not really confusing, sonce semodule should
already build the policy with an equivalent of -X 1, so -X 0 should
yield the same result.
