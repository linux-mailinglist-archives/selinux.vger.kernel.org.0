Possibly.  However, I don't feel like it is a very big ask to have
someone spend some time to provide a basic summary of the SMC protocol
and what might be needed from a SELinux perspective; that would help
increase my confidence in our SMC support significantly and perhaps
then I would feel comfortable with the simple mapping originally
proposed here.
