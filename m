Using /usr for factory policy files has been on my todo list for a long
time.

Files from /usr/etc/selinux and /usr/lib/selinux would be used as
default but they would be overridden by files in /etc/selinux resp
/var/lib/selinux. i.e. libselinux would first look into /etc/selinux and
if a file does not exist, look into /usr/etc/selinux. likewise for
libsemanage. It would also use modules from /usr/lib/selinux but
these modules would be overridden by modules from /var/lib/selinux

Policy rebuild (`semodule -R`) would install new policy and modules into
/etc and /var as it's now.
