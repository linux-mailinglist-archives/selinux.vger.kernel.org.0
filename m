I understand that many mail clients do not encourage inline/bottom
replies, but when posting to the various Linux Kernel mailing lists
please make the effort to reply inline, or at the bottom, as
appropriate.

Namespacing the SELinux kernel code is a rather tricky thing, both
with respect to the design and the mechanics of the implementation.  I
don't think we have a concrete idea yet on how we want to proceed in
all of the areas mentioned; designs - and implementations - have been
offered, but I think we are missing someone to drive the topic forward
with demonstrations, sample implementations, etc.  It is never a bad
idea to ask how you can help a project, but in this case I think the
answer is to step back for a moment, describe your use-case/problem,
explain how you envision a namespaced SELinux helping you resolve
this, and finally how you would want the namespaced SELinux
implementation to work (how would you interact with it both via policy
and runtime management).

On a personal note, the regular rebasing of the SELinux namespace work
has suffered lately due to other time commitments at work.  I have
recently (today) started a new position which should allow me to
dedicate much more of my working hours to upstream development; it may
take me a couple of weeks to get settled in, but you can expect the
regular rebasing of selinux/working-selinuxns to resume in the future.
