What do you mean by "multiple different target contexts"?
How should they be different and how should systemd know?

Socket unit configurations are normally paired with service unit
configurations (e.g. dovecot.socket <-> dovecot.service).
To handle incoming traffic the service unit configuration should
contain an ExecStart= directive, to start a program to handle the
data.
By default systemd tries at socket creation to predict the context of
the started program (via security_compute_create_raw(3) in
src/shared/selinux-util.c:mac_selinux_get_create_label_from_exe()),
see src/core/socket.c:socket_determine_selinux_label().

For example if the service unit contains ExecStart=/usr/bin/myapp and
/usr/bin/myapp has the context myapp_exec_t and the policy contains
`type_transition init_t myapp_exec_t:process myapp_t` systemd should
assign the context myapp_t to the socket specified in the socket unit
configuration.
