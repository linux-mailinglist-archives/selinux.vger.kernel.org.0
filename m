its a serialized message format, with all the data in the message
instead of pointer to external memory. If you want nicer to handle
you wrap a lib around it, this is pretty common. That is why I don't
see it as that different from the syscall.

At this level the lib provides the ease of use, but I think that is
what we are going to need with a syscall too, as marshalling variable
number/length data is always somewhat ugly.

Well you can, see the mess that is ioctl. The point being those internal
pointers are going to have to be mapped/copied and doing that is a mess
as well. Either way you want a common set of code to handle it. The
advantage of the syscall, from a userspace perspective, is that all the
code to handle the mapping is in the kernel.

The problem from kernel perspective is that multiple copies to/from
userspace have races. You have to make sure you have marshalled/setup
all the data before you can do anything with it.

Not necessarily the nil byte format, but yeah it all has to be setup
nicely in advance.

Well a few potential ones I can think of
version - providing future flexibility
count - for how many lsm entries to expect
size - I don't think its really necessary here but in a message format it is
        usually good to have a size of message value.
kind - some flags indicating the type of data. Eg. LSM name, LSM context pair
table - not necessary unless we want to get rid of the \0 separator so
         that \0 could be allowed as value within the data, an index into
         the message for each LSMs
         data.

At this point I don't really care if its a syscall or a serialized message.
I see them as roughly equivalent, its just a matter of where you are going to
put the ugly.
