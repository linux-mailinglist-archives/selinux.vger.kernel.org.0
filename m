No. We reached the opposite agreement of *not* requiring sigstruct to 
reside in a file at the interface level - i.e., security_enclave_init() 
takes a VMA but *not* a file struct as input.

At the implementation level, an LSM may require sigstruct to reside in a 
file. But that's a per-LSM decision.

I think everyone including Andy prefers not to pin any files. But it's a 
trade-off among code simplicity, auditing accuracy and memory 
consumption. I think the latest suggestion from Stephen was to keep 
files open, for SELinux. Again, that's a per-LSM decision.
