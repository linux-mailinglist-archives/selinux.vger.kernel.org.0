Thanks.  We've had such a tough history with namespacing that I'm a
little concerned it doesn't cover all of the corner cases, but
everytime I think of something new the idea still holds up.  I'm very
interested both to hear what everyone thinks and also to see if
someone can find any flaws in the concept.

I agree.  The permissions granted to the child namespace, including
the ability to relabel, would still be under control by policy in the
parent; if you don't want to grant the ability to relabel things don't
grant that permission in the parent.

I agree on this point too, that is one of the reasons I think we need
the mount options below.  If you don't use the mount options all of
the namespaces share a common view of the filesystem labels, with each
namespace defining their own policy towards those labels while still
being bounded by the permissions of their parent's namespace.  If you
do use the mount options you can delegate who "owns" the native
filesystem labeling with the parent seeing only a single label similar
to a context mount.

Or am I missing something in your reply?

Both are possible, it depends on if the proposed mount options are
used or not.  If you don't use the mount options you get a shared
view, if you do use the mount options you get a split view with
different labels in the parent and child.

I think so too.  It's also worth mentioning that in addition to the
immediate parent performing the mount, all of the prior parents
(grandparents, great-grandparents, etc.) would need to have policy
which allows mounting.

In that case I would mount the filesystem using a context mount.

Thanks, me too :)
