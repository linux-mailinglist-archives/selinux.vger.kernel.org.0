I can see how some of those tools are sensible for unprivileged users, 
but others (setenforce for example) seem clearly intended for privileged 
users.  On the whole, most of these utilities are dealing with the sort 
of policy details that the "Mandatory" part of MAC tends to want to 
leave to administrators.

And while selinuxfs is mounted with permissive "other" DAC perms, a lot 
of the access tends to be controlled much more granularly in SELinux 
policies.  Obviously a targeted policy with unconfined_t for regular 
users will grant all this access to unprivileged users, but I suspect 
that most implementations with more restrictions would be fairly liberal 
with security_t read access, less liberal with security_t write, and 
much less liberal with the more granular controls in the security object 
class.  A (very) quick skim through permission on my Fedora desktop 
seems to bear this out.

I think that the claim that those utilities that only require security_t 
read are fine for unprivileged users seems reasonable, things like 
setenforce, togglesebool, setfilecon and the compute_* family, to name a 
few all feel more like administrative utilities to me.

As a minor note, setsebool is located in policycoreutils and installed 
in sbin.  Separating setsebool from getsebool and togglesebool feels 
somewhat weird to me.
