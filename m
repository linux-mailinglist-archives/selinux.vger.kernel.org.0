I think from development view you would like to have a better
way to trap this events in userspace. One idea that I have is
is to have more outcomes from a rule. We have today allow,
dontaudit, auditallow i think it would be good to have signal sent too.
"signal-xxx-allow" for some set of signals. SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, SIGABRT maybe.

That will be a good way to pickup the problem with a debugger or generate a
a core file.

I have also done some selinux trace functions. I think they collide with this set,
but I think I can rebase them upon yours and see if they give some more functionality.

I see this functionality very much needed in some form.
