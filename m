Hmm, okay, there are probably a few other things we need to worry
about then from a SELinux point of view.  Smack may be okay since it
largely ignores sockets as a security entity, but Casey would be the
one to comment on that.  I'm not certain of the current AppArmor
network controls, or the other LSMs for that matter, but they should
be seeing this conversation on the LSM list so I assume they will
comment as necessary.

For SELinux the issue is that we need to track state in the sock
struct, via sock->sk_security, and that state needs to be initialized
and set properly.  Similarly with TCP request_sock structs, via
request_sock->{secid,peer_secid}.  Is the MPTCP code allocating and/or
otherwise creating socks or request_socks outside of the regular TCP
code?  We would also be concerned about socket structs, but I'm
guessing that code reuses the TCP code based on what you've said.
