We're using that as well but it really feels like this:

	prctl_map = (struct prctl_mm_map){
	    .start_code = start_code,
	    .end_code = end_code,
	    .start_stack = start_stack,
	    .start_data = start_data,
	    .end_data = end_data,
	    .start_brk = start_brk,
	    .brk = brk_val,
	    .arg_start = arg_start,
	    .arg_end = arg_end,
	    .env_start = env_start,
	    .env_end = env_end,
	    .auxv = NULL,
	    .auxv_size = 0,
	    .exe_fd = -1,
	};

should belong under ns_capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN). Why is that necessary to
relax?
