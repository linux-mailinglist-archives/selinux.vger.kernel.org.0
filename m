Looking through the RCU documentation again, it occurs to me that this 
would be simpler if I just called synchronize_rcu() after updating the 
policy pointer and then freed things directly rather than from rcu 
callback? I took the call_rcu() approach in this patch because that is 
what KaiGai did and what was done in the AVC but it seems like 
synchronize_rcu() is preferred when possible.
