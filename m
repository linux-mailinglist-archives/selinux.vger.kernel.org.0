Hmm.  Actually, let me change my comments slightly ... perhaps what we
should do here is keep the audit_log_format(), but change it from
audit_log_format("osid=%u",...) to audit_log_format("obj=?").  The "?"
is used in audit when we can't determine a piece of information, but
we normally log it.  It wasn't used very widely originally, which is
probably why it isn't in this piece of code.
