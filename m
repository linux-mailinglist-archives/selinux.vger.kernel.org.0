There's prompt which says:

"this command can remove all files in /tmp"

so users are already warned.

My problem is that when users run fixfiles twice, it could remove files
from /

Your problem is that when users use /tmp as a place for mountpoints,
running fixfiles (even once) could remove data from their mount points
inside /tmp.


They are just different issues.
