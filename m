no that is one use of them.

AppArmor is using namespaces for sub-confinement/priv sep They are also
used for tiered policy restrictions, and global black listing, and
unprivileged user and application policy.

depends on what you mean by configuration. There might be some config
of the namespace, but policy doesn't necessarily need to be loaded.
In both the unprivileged user and unprivileged application policy
cases, policy needs to be loaded after the the namespace is entered.

You can even split the container/orchastrator case, where LXD emulating
a system, will want to load the system policy as part of the OS boot
processes.

Where the docker/k8s/sandboxing use case have an orchestrator sandbox
app setup policy before hand.

possible. But ideally if we get it right they can expand the syscall
instead of an fs interface.

An fs interface has lots of problems like needing to be available within
a given namespace. If we want to be nesting namespaces (which we do),
then mounting custom FSes into the namespace is extra setup, and things
like proc may not even be available, depending on how the container is
being setup.

correct, at least in isolation. However if it is tied to other namespace
creation, say at clone/unshare, an LSM should be able to deny that and
have the whole set fail.

That is an individual LSM can deny the creation of other non-LSM
namespaces that are happening at the same time. This may affect the
creation of other LSM namespaces, but any given individual LSM is
not denying another LSM from creating a namespace.

there is good reason for it. Experience has shown forcing each LSM to
update policy for the policy of another LSM is problematic. Allowing
each LSM to manage itself based on its own policy while the rest of
the events are allow or fail, is very practical.

Its not about what an individual LSM is allowed but what is happening
at the system level. If system events are moving with the LSM event
the system event is fair game.

Even if we are talking individual LSM updates a two hook model may be
needed when taking into account the constraints of creds, and non-LSM
permission checks.

sure or another similar syscall. I don't think we are saying that it
has to be lsm_set_self_attr. More that it provides an example of how
to do this. It could be that it can be extended, it could be it turns
out that doing a new call that is similar but meets the constraints
is needed.

Yes, configuration requirements are definitely a per LSM thing.

yes setns from a security pov is problematic.

uhmmm, a unique container id? Well I guess that is one way to guarantee
this will never happen.

not at all. I think the distinction is the LSM hook is asking the LSM
that is being asked to be namespaced. That is each LSM is consulted about
itself.

oh it is, the perforamance people can get snippy about just a few
cycles. Ultimately that is just the cost of stacking policy. The
more layers you add the higher the cost.

AppArmor is already working towards a jit of policy that will be able
to flatten stacked policy, so the cost is can be pushed back to the
same as non-stacked. That however comes with the cost of increased
memory use, and it will only deal with the AppArmor part of the
whole stack.
