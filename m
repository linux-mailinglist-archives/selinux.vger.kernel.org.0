Totally doable, and you just copy + edit those scripts to achieve
that. Currently we inject the travis repo
with patches, which is the selinux userspace, into the VM image with
virt-sysprep.
But if this was selinux-testsuite ci you would just virt-sysprep
inject it's repo.

Stephen pointed out the additional ways userspace gets tested, and
perhaps my title and description
of the patch could be better. But the main point is to increase the
test coverage
and perform the testing steps we expect are done before a release in
the CI. We should have
the testing coverage and the confidence to release userspace from master at any
point. We also have forward facing proof that tests are being executed
and we can make sure
nothing regresses.

My ultimate goal here, is to help make sure that if Petr gets hit by a
bus, releases will
move forward without worry and without any change in quality among the various
maintainers.

Additionally, we pick up some cross project testing and can find other
surprises.
