Thanks Al.

Giving this a very quick look, I like the code simplifications that
come out of this change and I'll trust you on the idea that this
approach is better from a VFS perspective.

While the reject_all() permission hammer is good, I do want to make
sure we are covered from a file labeling perspective; even though the
DAC/reject_all() check hits first and avoids the LSM inode permission
hook, we still want to make sure the files are labeled properly.  It
looks like given the current SELinux Reference Policy this shouldn't
be a problem, it will be labeled like most everything else in
selinuxfs via genfscon (SELinux policy construct).  I expect those
with custom SELinux policies will have something similar in place with
a sane default that would cover the /sys/fs/selinux/.swapover
directory but I did add the selinux-refpol list to the CC line just in
case I'm being dumb and forgetting something important with respect to
policy.

The next step is to actually boot up a kernel with this patch and make
sure it doesn't break anything.  Simply booting up a SELinux system
and running 'load_policy' a handful of times should exercise the
policy (re)load path, and if you want a (relatively) simple SELinux
test suite you can find one here:

* https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-testsuite

The README.md should have the instructions necessary to get it
running.  If you can't do that, and no one else on the mailing list is
able to test this out, I'll give it a go but expect it to take a while
as I'm currently swamped with reviews and other stuff.
