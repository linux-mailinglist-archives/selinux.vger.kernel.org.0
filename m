Thanks to Dominick, I have made at least some progress: I can get the
role to transition,
but not the user or the process type. Details below.

That rule was already present (it is the only one I really need, these
users will be coming in via SSH only).

I added process_user_target to the type definition, no effect:

    type xferHigh2Local_t, CDTml_types, userdomain, process_user_target;

> > The user type needs to be a bin and shell entry type:
> > allow xferHigh2Local_t { bin_t shell_exec_t }:file entrypoint;

Also added that, after testing process_user_target, no effect. (So I
had all three suggestions active.)

I then added

    role_transition system_r sshd_exec_t CDTml_high2local_r;

and this got me my first real progress - 'id -Z' now shows:

    system_u:CDTml_high2local_r:unconfined_t:s0

> > There is probably more that i am overlooking but these, i think, are

Any other suggestions would be most welcome! I am at a loss,
especially since the
*_u "types" are not part of the policy but are defined via semanage,
and I already have
rules for the _t types, via an existing rules:

    allow { sshd_t unconfined_t } xferHigh2Local_t:process transition;

What surprises me most is that originally nothing showed up in ausearch.
I suppose this is because either PAM or SSHD is doing the computation
and not logging it in audit.log, but that is just a guess, likely misguided.

However! After that last allow, above, I finally have errors in ausearch,
many repeats of:

    libsepol.context_from_record: invalid security context:
"system_u:CDTml_high2local_r:sshd_t:s0"
    libsepol.context_from_record: could not create context structure
    libsepol.context_from_string: could not create context structure
    libsepol.sepol_context_to_sid: could not convert
system_u:CDTml_high2local_r:sshd_t:s0 to sid
    libsepol.context_from_record: invalid security context:
"system_u:CDTml_high2local_r:unconfined_t:s0"
    libsepol.context_from_record: could not create context structure
    libsepol.context_from_string: could not create context structure
    libsepol.sepol_context_to_sid: could not convert
system_u:CDTml_high2local_r:unconfined_t:s0 to sid

I then expanded the basic allow rule for the CDTml_high2local_r role:

   role CDTml_high2local_r types {
       sshd_t
       unconfined_t
       xferHigh2Local_t
       xferHigh2Local_exec_t
   };

This didn't get me any farther, though.

Do I need to widen the roles associated with CDTml_high2local_u at login?

I really am trying to keep them as tight as possible. (Which,
incidentally, is one
of the reasons I am using "old school" rules and not CIL: the M4 macros may
do more than I need them to....)

Thanks,

P

PS apologies to all for the double send of the original, user error (PEBCAD).
