The check in IMA to allow the new IMA hook func LSM_STATE and LSM_POLICY 
when SELinux is enabled is just because SELinux is the only security 
module using these hooks now.

To enable AppArmor, for instance, to use the new IMA hooks to measure 
state and policy would just require adding the check for 
CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR. Other than that, there are no IMA changes 
needed to support AppArmor or other such security modules.

Please see Patch 1/4

+			else if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX) &&
+				 strcmp(args[0].from, "LSM_STATE") == 0)
+				entry->func = LSM_STATE;
+			else if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX) &&
+				 strcmp(args[0].from, "LSM_POLICY") == 0)
+				entry->func = LSM_POLICY;

And, if early boot measurement is needed for AppArmor the following 
change in IMA's Kconfig

Patch 4/4

+config IMA_QUEUE_EARLY_BOOT_DATA
  	bool
+	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX || (IMA_MEASURE_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS && 
SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYRING)
  	default y

If you think calling this an "LSM feature" is not appropriate, please 
suggest a better phrase.

But like I said above, with minimal change in IMA other security modules 
can be supported to measure STATE and POLICY data.
