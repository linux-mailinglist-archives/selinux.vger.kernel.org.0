If 'concept' doesn't work as a term, we can call it an agreement on
the co-existence of multiple security models.

Given the above, a full stop may be in order.

Perhaps, in pursuit of wisdom, we should call for a general consensus
among the group as to whether or not we have any clue as to what we
are doing?

Unfortunately that would seem to collide with the general consensus
that has evolved around 'stacking', as the means by which Linux
supports multiple LSM based security models/architectures.

The kernel security architecture admits to the notion that all of
the active LSM's have to agree that a specific security event be
allowed.  If any LSM elects to deny a hook call, permission is denied
for the event.

John responded to our e-mail in this thread and clarified that he
doesn't believe that a POSIX 1e style capability for namespace
separation is required.  However, our understanding from his reply is
that he felt that LSM namespace creation itself should have its own
LSM hook/event.

If this is the case, to be consistent with the stacking architecture,
any LSM should have the ability to deny security namespace creation
through its interpretation of the LSM namespace creation hook.

For example, it would certainly seem to be a valid concept for
something like an enhanced 'lockdown' mode to deny the ability for any
processes to escape into an LSM policy domain other than what was
configured when the platform was placed in a locked down status.

If we don't adhere to this model, we will have a 'snowflake' to
contend with in the LSM security model.

That provides basic infrastructure, however, with concession to the
general acknowledgement that every LSM is different, the requirement
for every attribute to have a unique descriptive identity value may
prove restrictive, particularly in model based LSM's.

What may be needed is an agnostic attribute identifier that
orchestration software could use, in combination with the 'flags'
variable to specify exactly what type of attribute is being delivered
by the system call to an LSM.  In other words, the attribute would
tell an LSM to interpret the flags value as an indicator of the
payload being delivered.

Irregardless of merit, it will be reality, see below.

It appears that John is thinking that an LSM hook is what will be
needed, so no new capability bit would be required.

That concept seems consistent with the precedence that was established
by using this type of scheme to control the creation of user
namespaces.

It appears you have already created the necessary infrastructure with
lsm_set_self_attr(2).

Given the apparent consensus that an LSM is free to implement
namespaces in whatever manner it pleases, an LSM can offer
configuration of an instance of its security namespace with an LSM
specific pseudo-filesystem interface.

If a centralized namespace separation is pursued, what will be
required is a method for loading policy/configuration before execution
starts in the context of the namespace.

Per-container security policy is the expectation that will be raised
by the creation of LSM namespaces.  We can speak very directly to that
fact, from conversations with groups that are running fleets of
thousands of virtual machines supporting tens of thousands of
container instances.

A 'container' is a set of kernel resource domains applied to an
execution workload.  An LSM namespace will be another resource domain
that is placed around the workload by an orchestration system.

Speaking from personal implementation experience.  If the LSM
namespace is entered and configured before the container runtime
engine is started, you have in effect, created a per container
security policy for that workload.

There are a plethora of issues surrounding this but it may be best to
leave those to further evolution of this discussion.

Have a good remainder of the week.
