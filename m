Thanks Ondrej, I've merged this into selinux/next and added the stable
kernel CC.  Normally when we mark something for stable I send it up to
Linus during the -rcX development phase, but I think this case is
somewhat unique in that it isn't widespread (and there is no
indication it will become widespread) and it requires privilege to
trigger.  Also, while not a major factor, we are at -rc5 which means
we are very near the end of the -rcX cycle and I'd rather not
accidentally break something else this late in an attempt to fix such
a limited problem.

Comments and objections are welcome ;)
