I agree, but I didn't/don't have the time to do that for the other
tests, I saw this one and I fixed it :)

No, but not because I think those changes are wrong, it's because I
don't agree with the approach.  Let me try to explain ...

It is my personal opinion that with few exceptions, a maintainer
should not alter a patch significantly beyond the normal fuzz that can
sometimes happen when there are merge conflicts.  Of course there are
trivial changes sometimes, e.g. a missing semicolon, whitespace
issues, etc. which are okay to fixup (with a note in the commit!), but
changes of more than a couple of lines, or changes that impact the
logic of the patch, are not something a maintainer should be doing as
a normal practice.  I am not a lawyer, so please don't take this as a
valid interpretation of the laws involved, but I can see legal reasons
for this: if the maintainer changes the patch in a significant way, I
imagine that could potentially muddy the idea of authorship, would the
maintainer now also be considered an author of that patch?  How could
one clearly distinguish between the original author's code and the
mainatiner's changes?  Sure, there is the mailing list, but what if
the mailing list is not available and all you have is the git log?
However, the biggest issue that I see is that of community building.
Having a back-and-forth with a patch contributor can help both welcome
them to the community and teach them what is expected from a patch
submission point of view.  It might be easier and quicker for you just
to edit the existing patch, but it's better for the community to take
the time and ask the original submitter if they could make the change.

Does that make sense?
