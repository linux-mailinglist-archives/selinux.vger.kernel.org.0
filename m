Hello,

A few weeks ago, OSS-Fuzz got configured in order to fuzz the CIL
policy compiler. One of the issue it reported was a "Stack-overflow in
__cil_resolve_name_with_parents", which seemed strange
(https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=28491, for
future reference).

By looking into it, the reduced test-case is the following CIL policy:

(optional o
    (block b
        (block b
            (blockabstract b0)
        )
        (blockinherit b)
    )
)
(blockinherit b)

When building this policy with secilc, the command seems to be caught
in a loop that never ends. Using gdb to break somewhere leads to the
following call stack:

However, if I understand correctly the documentation
(https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/master/secilc/docs/cil_container_statements.md),
having two "(block b)" and a "(blockabstract b0)" that does not
reference "b" are not supposed to work. Maybe the CIL compiler needs
to detect such issues and fail instead of entering some kind of loop.
How should this issue be fixed?

Nicolas
