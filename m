Im happly fine with replacing the selinux_audited with selinux_denied.  However it is the case where there are more than one denial at the same time. Im not sure how and when it might happen.
When that happen we got more than one event. I have no problems with that, but im not sure if the debug tools and perf can make sense of that.

A other feature with the selinux_audited event it might be inserted on other places in the code too.  A denial is sort of final.
