Hi,
This sounds like a nice idea :) Also it appears it only takes 5
minutes to run the whole Travis CI job of setting the Fedora VM up and
booting it, which is more than acceptable in term of delays (and is
very quicker than building and testing the project itself). This could
allow to run more tests that require to be able to manage the SELinux
policy, automatically at every pull requests.

By the way I wasn't expecting Travis-CI to easily allow nested
virtualization ("nested" because jobs are already run inside VMs,
IIRC). If it works, it is great!

Some quick thoughts/suggestions/comments that I have in my head after
reading very quickly your changes:
- The networking setup of the VM seems to be more complex than needed
because you are relying on getting the IP address from DHCP. Would it
be possible to configure libvirt with port forwarding, so that "ssh -p
2222 127.0.0.1" always work? (with raw QEMU, the command-line
parameters would be something like -net
nic,model=virtio,macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56 -net
user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22)
- Usually the helper scripts are located in directory scripts/, which
make them more easily discovered by people reading the code (hidden
files and directories seems more appropriate to store the
configuration for different CI platforms that require them ; some
projects choose to hide everything that is not useful for the build
process but here it does seem to be so). Are there advantages of using
.ci/ directory?
- Moreover having a "fedora-test.run" (or "fedora-test.sh", I am more
used to .sh extension for shell scripts) enables to easily reproduce
tests on a local development machine using "vagrant init
fedora/32-cloud-base && vagrant ssh" + "sudo
/vagrant/.../fedora-test.run". Such a command could be documented in
the header of the shell script.
- Right now, there are many things in .travis.yml. This file could be
split in shell script(s) if that reduces duplication.
- To verify the download of Fedora cloud image, instead of hard-coding
its SHA256 digest, you could download the checksum file which is
signed using GnuPG and check its signature, as described on
https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/

Cheers,
Nicolas
