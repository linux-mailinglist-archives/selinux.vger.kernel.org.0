No, just wasn't cc'd previously.  I don't think we want any LSM check
here.  As the long term fix, I would suggest moving the
security_file_permission() call up from rw_verify_area() to the
callers (and not call it from kernel_write() at all).

Yes, controlling pipe writes is just one part of controlling
information flow between processes but the intent here is to control
userspace actions, not kernel-internal operations.
