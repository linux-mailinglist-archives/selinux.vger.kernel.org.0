Hmm, so are you implying that anon inodes should be thought of the
same as control /dev nodes? I.e. that even though there may be many
one-time actual inodes created by different processes, they should be
thought of as a single "static interface" to the respective kernel
functionality? That would justify having a common type/label for all
of them, but I'm not sure if it doesn't open some gap due to the
possibility to pass the associated file descriptors between processes
(as AFAIK, these can hold some context)...

I thought this was supposed to resemble more the way BPF, perf_event,
etc. support was implemented - the BPF and perf_event fds are also
anon inodes under the hood, BTW - where each file descriptor is
considered a separate object that inherits the label of its creator
and there is some class separation (e.g. bpf vs. perf_event).
