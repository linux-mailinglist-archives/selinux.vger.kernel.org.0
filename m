That might very well be a good feasible option actually. I also took a
look at what actually needs labelling and came up with another idea too
to label each member (effectively the IPC endpoints) with a context.

This actually would not require an xperm, and in theory could be a dbus
only change! I think it would be nice however to support emitting the
dbus_contexts file from policy (similar to fc files and filecons in cil
and kernel policy language), although I understand this is a pretty big
change (although actually quite scoped) so very open to feedback on it.

Here is a snippet of pseudopolicy I came up with last night:

(in polkit

    (block dbus

      (dbuspeer peer "org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1")

      (type CheckAuthorization)
      (roletype .sys.role CheckAuthorization)

      (context CheckAuthorization_context (.sys.id .sys.role CheckAuthoriza=
tion .sys.lowlow))

      (dbuscon system "/org/freedesktop/PolicyKit1/Authority"
       "org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Authority" "CheckAuthorization" peer
       CheckAuthorization_context)))

(type mysubj)
(roletype .sys.role mysubj)

(allow mysubj .polkit.dbus.CheckAuthorization (dbus (send)))

We then wire up dbus to support labelling members as the IPC endpoints
with a context, and have the dbuscon statements emit a dbus_contexts
file.

dbuscon isn't really a requirement, although I think it would be a nice
to have. Regardless, I'll wait a bit before submitting any patches to
the dbus upstream at FDO incase anyone from the community has design
concerns or feature requests they'd like implemented, considering this
is a pretty major change to dbus, community approval is desired in the
design.
