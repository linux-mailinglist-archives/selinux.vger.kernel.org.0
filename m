In addition to other changes we've discussed, it looks like squashing
1/3 and 2/3 is going to change things quite a bit, so I'm going to
suggest you make the changes you're planning to make, including
squashing the two patches, and repost.  We can re-review the new
revision and pick up the discussion from there.

Does that sound okay?
