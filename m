[Adding Chuck Lever to the CC line as I believe he has the most recent
LSM experience from the NFS side - sorry Chuck :)]

I'll need to ask your patience on this as I am far from a NFS expert.

Looking through the NFS readdir/getdents code this evening, I was
wondering if the solution in the readdir case is to simply tell the
server you are not interested in the security label by masking out
FATTR4_WORD2_SECURITY_LABEL in the nfs4_readdir_arg->bitmask in
_nfs4_proc_readdir()?  Of course this assumes that the security label
genuinely isn't needed in this case (and not requesting it doesn't
bypass access controls or break something on the server side), and we
don't screw up some NFS client side cache by *not* fetching the
security label attribute.

Is this remotely close to workable, or am I missing something fundamental?
