Whether IMA or SELinux calculates the in memory policy hash, it should
not impact the original purpose of this patch set - measuring critical
state.  It's unclear whether this patch set needs to be limited to LSM
critical state.

Measuring the in memory policy, if needed, should be a separate patch
set.
