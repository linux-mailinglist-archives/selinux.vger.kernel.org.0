That is an interesting question: do we consider dmesg output to be
part of the stable kernel API?  My hunch would be "no", as I've seen
things change quite a bit there over the years, but IANL (I Am Not
Linus).  However, that said, logging a reason string via audit seems
like a good idea (especially since there is presently a many-to-one
mapping between reasons and the SELinux permission).  Further, while
the audit field name is part of the kernel API, the value is much more
open.

Since this seems security relevant, I wonder if we should be using SELINUX_ERR?

True, although I'm not overly worried about the need to use policy
capabilities; I'm more worried about jumping into too fine a
granularity before we see how this will be used.
