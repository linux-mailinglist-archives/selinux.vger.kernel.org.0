I don't really understand what checkpolicy is doing. I guess keeping
track of the postfix stack size?

The one difference that would be easy to fix is that checkpolicy ignores "not".

CIL has a max depth = 4, but checkpolicy has a max depth = 0 for these:
(constrain (C5 (P5)) (not (not (not (not (eq t1 T5a))))))
constrain C5 { P5 } not (not (not (not (t1 == T5a))));

Here is one pair of examples that would be hard for me to make CIL
agree with checkpolicy. These are essentially the same constraint:

Both see max depth = 2 for this one
(constrain (C6 (P6)) (or (eq t1 T6g) (and (neq t1 A6a) (neq t2 T6f))))
constrain C6 { P6 } (t1 == T6g or (t1 != A6a and t2 != T6f));

CIL sees max depth = 2 for this one, but checkpolicy has max depth = 1
(constrain (C7 (P7)) (or (and (neq t1 A7a) (neq t2 T7f)) (eq t1 T7g)))
constrain C7 { P7 } ((t1 != A7a and t2 != T7f) or t1 == T7g);

In most other examples that I have created, they had the same max depth.

Both have max depth = 2 for these:
(constrain (C1 (P1)) (or (eq t1 T1a) (and (eq t1 T1b) (eq t1 T1c))))
constrain C1 { P1 } (t1 == T1a or (t1 == T1b and t1 == T1c));

Both have max depth = 4 for these:
(constrain (C2 (P2)) (or (eq t1 T2a) (or (eq t1 T2b) (or (eq t1 T2c)
(and (eq t1 T2d) (eq t1 T2e))))))
constrain C2 { P2 } (t1 == T2a or (t1 == T2b or (t1 == T2c or (t1 ==
T2d and t1 == T2e))));

Both have max depth = 3 for these:
(constrain (C4 (P4)) (or (or (eq t1 T4a) (or (eq t1 T4b) (eq t1 T4c)))
(or (eq t1 T4d) (and (eq t1 T4e) (eq t1 T4f)))))
constrain C4 { P4 } ((t1 == T4a or (t1 == T4b or t1 == T4c)) or (t1 ==
T4d or (t1 == T4e and t1 == T4f)));

Both have max depth = 4 for these:
(constrain (C8 (P8)) (or (or (or (and (neq t1 T8a) (neq t1 T8b)) (and
(neq t1 T8c) (neq t1 T8d))) (or (and (neq t1 T8e) (neq t1 T8f)) (and
(neq t1 T8g) (neq t1 T8h)))) (or (or (and (neq t1 T8i) (neq t1 T8j))
(and (neq t1 T8k) (neq t1 T8l))) (or (and (neq t1 T8m) (neq t1 T8n))
(and (neq t1 T8o) (neq t1 T8p))))))
constrain C8 { P8 } ((((t1 != T8a and t1 != T8b) or (t1 != T8c and t1
!= T8d)) or ((t1 != T8e and t1 != T8f) or (t1 != T8g and t1 != T8h)))
or (((t1 != T8i and t1 != T8j) or (t1 != T8k and t1 != T8l)) or ((t1
!= T8m and t1 != T8n) or (t1 != T8o and t1 != T8p))));

I guess I can convert the expressions to postfix and then follow the
logic of checkpolicy, but that seems to be a lot of work. Instead, I
could add a second check when the binary is being created and the
constraint expression has been turned into postfix already.
