Since we've been discussing general best practices for submitting
patches in this thread (and the other related thread), I wanted to
(re)clarify my thoughts around maintainers fixing patches when merging
them upstream.

When in doubt, do not ever rely on the upstream maintainer fixing your
patch while merging it, and if problems do arise during review, it is
best to not ask the maintainer to fix them for you, but for you to fix
them instead (you are the patch author after all!).  Similarly, making
comments along the lines of "X can fix both easily when applying", is
also a bad thing to say when reviewing patches.  It's the patch
author's responsibility to fix the patch by address review comments,
not the maintainer.  I'll typically let you know if you don't need to
rework a patch(set).

That said, there are times when the maintainer will change the patch
during merging, most of which are due to resolving merge
conflicts/fuzz with changes already in the tree (that *is* the
maintainer's responsibility).  Speaking for myself, sometimes I will
also make some minor changes if the patch author is away, or
unreliable, or if there is a hard deadline near and I'm worried that
the updated patch might not be ready in time.  I'll also sometimes
make the changes directly if the patch is holding up a larger, more
important patch(set), but that is really rare.  I'm sure I've made
changes for other reasons in the past, and I'm sure I'll make changes
for other reasons in the future, but hopefully this will give you a
better idea of how the process works :)
