Ok. Will do.

Will do. I will go with "critical_data". You also have suggested it in
the comment below.

"critical_data_sources" also seems right, but that's more wordy than
"critical_data".

Some more options we considered, but they don’t sound right.
Please let us know what do you think.
1. "critical_data_sources="
2. "critical_kernel_components=" -or- "crit_krnl_comps="
3. "critical_data_providers="
4. "critical_kernel_data_providers=" -or- "crit_krnl_dt_provs="
5. "critical_kernel_data_sources=" -or- "crit_krnl_dt_srcs="
6. "security_critical_data="
7. "protectable_data="
8. "protected_data="
9. "vital_protected_data="

I agree. But the unique issue we are facing here is there are two
"first users" of this new "base series".

One, SeLinux work (driven by Lakshmi); and two, device-mapper/dm-crypt 
work (driven by me).

Both of them need to be reviewed by different maintainers, may go 
through several iterations before getting accepted.

That’s why we wanted to keep this "base series" independent of the 
"first users"; and called the "base series" as a dependency in the 
dm-crypt[1] / SeLinux[2] series.

We would appreciate your guidance on how we can better author these
three series - 1.this base series 2. dm-crypt series and 3. SeLinux
series.

[2]SeLinux Series: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11762287/
