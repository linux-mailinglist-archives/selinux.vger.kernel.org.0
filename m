If I build that policy, then the resulting policy yields the following 
values for the watch* and subsequent permissions:
0x00010000 watch
0x00020000 watch_mount
0x00040000 watch_reads
0x00080000 watch_sb
0x00100000 watch_with_perm
0x00200000 write
0x00400000 audit_access
0x00800000 entrypoint
0x01000000 execmod
0x02000000 execute_no_trans
0x04000000 open

You can see this yourself with the attached program.

Contrast that with the deprecated definitions in 
/usr/include/selinux/av_permissions.h that were generated from the old 
refpolicy access_vectors file long ago:
#define FILE__MOUNTON                             0x00010000UL
#define FILE__EXECUTE_NO_TRANS                    0x00020000UL
#define FILE__ENTRYPOINT                          0x00040000UL
#define FILE__EXECMOD                             0x00080000UL
#define FILE__OPEN                                0x00100000UL

So when cron tries to check FILE__ENTRYPOINT, it ends up checking the 
bit for watch_reads instead.

In order to avoid this, you would need to synchronize your common_file 
and file definitions to ensure that your policy still defines entrypoint 
with the same value.  This is what I was trying to achieve by 
recommending moving the watch* permissions and map permission to the end 
of the classes. However, what I didn't realize was that you have made 
multiple other changes to your common_file and file definitions that 
have perturbed the values in other ways, e.g. you removed swapon 
(thereby shifting back the values, effectively canceling out the 
addition of map, such that moving map now actually yields an incorrect 
entrypoint value).  And while you did move audit_access in front of 
entrypoint in the class file definition, it was already the case that 
entrypoint was second in the list originally (the first used to be 
execute_no_trans until you sorted them).

If I apply the attached change to merely move the watch permissions, 
then the correct value is assigned to entrypoint and everything should 
work even without the cron patch.

All that said, I think the cron patch is the right fix - I just wanted 
to understand what was happening here, which I think I now do.

Date: Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:43:58 -0400
Subject: [PATCH] Move watch* permissions from common_file to the classes.

To avoid perturbing the value of file entrypoint permission,
which breaks legacy cron.
