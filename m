That seems reasonable to me.

Not really, but some of that is simply because I tend to bounce around
between editors depending on what type of work I'm doing.  My fingers
have more or less gotten used to it and do the right thing as a matter
of habit these days.

In the non-kernel projects I maintain there is a script which you can
run that checks the formatting/style, and optionally fixes it for you
(in the case of C, it's a wrapper around astyle); I lean on that a lot
for those projects.  It would be nice to have something like that
here, but we would need to do a lot of style fixes first.  I keep
threatening to do that, but it never quite seems worth it; perhaps I
should start doing that slowly.
