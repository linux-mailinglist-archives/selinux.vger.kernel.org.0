Thanks. Will update the subject line accordingly.

Sure. Thanks a lot for giving an example wording for us. Will update.

I am not sure if you have any concerns about the last two paragraphs.
The description about the attestation client and server (the last two
paragraphs) was added for information/clarification purpose only, as per
your feedback on previous iterations. The subsequent patches don’t have
any code pertaining to attestation client/server.

*Question*
Maybe the last two paragraphs are confusing/redundant. Could you please
let me know if I should remove the above two paragraphs altogether? 
(starting with “To use the functionality introduced in this patch ...”)

If we decide to keep the paragraphs, I will remove the specific examples
(KEXEC_CMDLINE, SeLinux etc.) as you mentioned elsewhere.
