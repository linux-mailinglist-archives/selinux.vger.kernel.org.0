Yes, will do. I will also describe what kernel integrity critical data
is – by providing a definition, and not by example -  as you suggested.
(here and in the cover letter)

Sounds good. I will remove this paragraph.

*Question*
Thanks Mimi. Do you want us just to update the description, or do you
want us to update the function name too?

I believe you meant just description, but still want to clarify.

ima_measure_kernel_integrity_critical_data() would be too long.
Maybe ima_measure_integrity_critical_data()?

Or do you want us to keep the existing ima_measure_critical_data()?
Could you please let us know?

*Question*
Do you mean the parameter @event_data_source should be removed from this
patch? And then later added in patch 7/7 – where SeLinux uses it?

But ima_measure_critical_data() calls process_buffer_measurement(), and
p_b_m() accepts it as part of the param @func_data.

What should we pass to p_b_m() @func_data in this patch, if we remove
@event_data_source from this patch?

Ok. I will change this to @eventname to be consistemt with p_b_m().

*Question*
Hi Mimi, will do.
Do you want the data_source to be part of SeLinux patch? (patch 7/7 of
this series).
Or a separate patch before it?
