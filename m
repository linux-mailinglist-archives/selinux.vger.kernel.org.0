Can we do the following instead:

In ima_measure_critical_data() IMA hook, we can add another param for 
the caller to indicate whether

  => The contents of "buf" needs to be measured
     OR
  => Hash of the contents of "buf" needs to be measured.

This way IMA doesn't need to export any new function to meet the hashing 
requirement.
