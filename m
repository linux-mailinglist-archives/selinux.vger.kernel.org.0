Could there really be a case where a permission check for "execmod" 
could be reachable for class "dir"? Executing on some strange file 
system which does not distinguish files from directories?

OK. I tested the check with some compilers at godbolt.org and it seems 
that with optimization enabled the check disappears, so there should be 
no change in performance.
