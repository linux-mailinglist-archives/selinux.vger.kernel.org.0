This sounds reasonable.  However, these days libselinux
selinux_restorecon(3) which gets used internally by
setfiles/restorecon (which is what fixfiles executes to perform
relabeling) should be automatically excluding any filesystems that do
not support security labeling based on /proc/self/mounts and the
seclabel option.  Hence, manual exclude lists should only be necessary
for filesystem types that support security labeling by userspace
and/or for running setfiles/fixfiles when SELinux is disabled (e.g. to
label before first booting with SELinux enabled).
