Originally I think the initial list of folks were all added as
"owners", but as we added maintainers to the various projects it seems
the new additions defaulted to "members".  You should be all set as an
owner now Ondrej, and if any of the other current maintainers would
also like to have their roles adjusted feel free to ping me off-list.
