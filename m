The virtiofs proposal has the same problem. Any "mapping" mechanism
has the same problem. The virtiofs mechanism puts guest MAC data into
attributes protected by DAC on the host. It has a number of other
issues that have been discussed on the thread. It's a clever hack,
but like most clever hacks some clever attacker(s) probably already
have exploits lined up.

If mapping labels and/or policy is too expensive and/or difficult,
what does make sense? I mean in general, not in just in a special
case like a VM host exporting a filesystem to its guest?
