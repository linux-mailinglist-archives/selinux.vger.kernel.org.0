If there's a problem with the audit system you should be
looking at fixing that rather than tacking information that's
useless for capabilities onto it's interfaces.

If you're not changing how capabilities work you

Capabilities do not implement a fine grained policy.
This has been lamented ad nauseam regarding CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
It is also irrelevant to the issue here.=20

I'm not arguing against that goal, I'm saying that you're
going about it the wrong way.

Might? Show me someone who's looked at capabilities who
doesn't think the design is flawed! The entire POSIX 1003.1e/2c
group knew it was flawed, which is the primary reason it never
got past DRAFT status. If capabilities had been perfect no one
would ever have been tempted to add domain enforcement.

But there it is. That is not an excuse to muddle it up
with pass-through parameters in an effort to wiggle around
the issues in other facilities.

I'll see if I can squeeze some time into alternatives, but
my brain is already wrestling with audit issues of my own.
