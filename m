I said that I'm not sure how they go about doing Android on Ubuntu.
I brought it up because I've seen it.

The kernel developers aren't the consumers of these APIs. There
has been considerable feedback from system application developers
on the interfaces. This included dbus and systemd. Kernel developers
aren't interested in these APIs because they don't care one way or
the other. That, and as you are painfully aware, some of them are
really busy on their own projects.

Am I really happy with the "hideous" format? Yeah, because it makes
the end user happy. Am I happy with interface_lsm? Other than the
name, which was the result of feedback, yes, because it in the
simplest way to accomplish the goal.

I am curious about what you think is "bad" about the current design.
The interfaces aren't exciting. They don't need to be.

Why? A combined-label API is what the application developers asked for.

??????? This is exactly what I've provided.

	"apparmor\0unconfined\0smack\0User\0"

You know exactly what LSMs are providing data and what that data is.
How could it be clearer or cleaner?

Are you saying that interface_lsm changes the /proc/.../attr/current API?
That API is already dependent on the active security module. You may get
an AppArmor, SELinux or Smack context from that API. It's been thus for a
long time. Creating the smack and apparmor subdirectories was done to help
make this cleaner. But those are new APIs. The existing applications either
allow for a variety of security modules (e.g. ps(1)) or need to check for
a particular one (e.g. id(1), which doesn't need to and would be better if
it didn't, but what the hay). If they don't they are flawed and should be
repaired.

Agreed. That's why the proposed APIs have been discussed with many
of those application communities.

That's what I've been proposing all along. You don't like the APIs.
What don't you like about them? I believe they address the objections
you've raised. I know that I can be real obtuse from time to time,
but I don't see how they fail to meet your requirements.
