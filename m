FWIW, I think I'm the only one regularly running the tests on upstream
kernels and reporting the results.  RH was running the tests at one
point, and may still be doing so, but I have no idea what kernels they
are testing (maybe just RHEL, stable Fedora, etc.) and what their
process is when they find failures.

I also try to enable everything that I can enable for my test runs.
Thanks to Mellanox I can even run the IB tests.

That's a good point about the other networking tests.  My gut feeling
tells me that NFS should be "different", but I guess I can't really
justify that statement in an objectively meaningful way.
