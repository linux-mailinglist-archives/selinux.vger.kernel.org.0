Thanks!

From a user perspective it looks as if that might indeed might be
possible/feasible (I do not know about any technical considerations though). Then
there is, i guess, also the compatilibity question.

As an aside. When trying "mypolicy" I noticed a few strange things
related to the unlabeled isid (but might also apply to the file isid)

1. When one runs `make install; sed
's/SELINUXTYPE=.*/SELINUXTYPE=mypolicy' /etc/selinux/policy ; semodule
-B ; sestatus ; ls -alZ /`, the old labels still show up, even though
the old labels were effectively invalidated.

I guess maybe the whatever `ls` uses to get the labels, might not have
been "updated" to get the context associated with the unlabeled isid
instead of the actual (old) contexts. A reboot solves that issue.

2. The first step to get to work with "mypolicy" is to enable labeling
for any non-volatite filesystems you may have. I decided to not cover
that in my policy because I do not know what filesystem one uses and I
didnt want to pretent that I can maintain "fsuse xattr" statements for
all possible candidates. I also feels inefficient, no need to have
fsuse rules for filesystems you dont have.

Anyhow, when one runs `echo '(fsuse xattr "ext4" (sys.id sys.role
sys.isid ((s0)(s0))))' > myfs.cil && semodule -i myfs.cil && reboot,
systemd failes to create the sock files for socket activated daemons
(like dbus), and so these daemons fail to start. systemd reports that it
is unable to determine the socket contexts.

It seems as if whatever code systemd uses to determine said socket
contexts, uses old labels (that are still associated with the inodes,
because have havent relabeled the filesystem yet after we added the
fsuse ruke) associated with the inodes to compute socket contexts (and
there fore fails)

Running `restorecon -RF / && reboot` fixes the above issue.
