What do you think about moving avc_create_thread call (if
avc_using_threads is set) into avc_netlink_acquire_fd().

That way, if the caller is using avc_init with a create_thread
callback, they can get their netlink socket and create the netlink
thread and everything will function as before. In theory, this would
also work for the sestatus netlink fallback.
