Why can't you just define a single unconfined attribute with
associated allow rules, and then define multiple domains that
have that attribute?  Where is the duplication occurring?  Name-based
type transitions?  IMHO, those should be used far more
sparsely than they are presently in Fedora and there has been some
optimization recently in how they are internally represented.

default_type was to support providing a default type to use when only
a role was specified to e.g. newrole or pam_selinux.  Not sure that's
a problem.

Probably needs to be converted to using selinux_check_access().
