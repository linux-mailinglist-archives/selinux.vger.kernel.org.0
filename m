setcon(3) would avoid the need for a separate exec but requires more
trust in the caller. Up to you as to which model works for your use
case.  Originally SELinux only supported setexeccon(3) but setcon(3)
was added particularly for MLS users and has since been leveraged
elsewhere.  mod_selinux uses setcon(3).  xinetd LABELED uses
setexeccon(3) since it was already exec'ing a separate child daemon.
