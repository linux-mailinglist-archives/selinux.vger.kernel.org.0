Thanks. I blew out my acronym processor in the 1990's while

Are you talking about read access to map_files owned by other users
or write access to map_files for the current user?

CAP_SYS_ADMIN exists for system behaviors that are not policy enforcement=
,
but important to the system nonetheless. If you argue that checkpoint/res=
tart
is system policy enforcement rather then an administrative task it would
be easier to sell.

Nobody likes CAP_SYS_ADMIN, but usually a process that does one of the
things it covers will do more (sometimes many more) of the things it
covers. The longstanding problem with breaking up CAP_SYS_ADMIN is that
most breakouts result in programs that still need CAP_SYS_ADMIN anyway.

Excellent!

Now, is there any reason other than your program that a process would
use CAP_RESTORE? If a process has this capability what damage could it
do to the system?
