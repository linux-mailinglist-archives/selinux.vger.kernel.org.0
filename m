Adding IP_SECURITY seems sensible. Having both at the same time leaves
us with the question of which security module's value to put in SCM_SECURITY
when there are multiple choices. I assume we'd use the first available
value, as determined by the LSM list order, or the interface_lsm if we're
supporting that concept. And again, that's a problem for the complete
stacking round.

Also sensible, although I think SO_PEERCONTEXT or SO_PEERCTX is a better
name than SO_PEERSEC2. Also a problem for complete stacking and it is
way to early for me to get into bikeshedding.

Good idea. I'm reading the official how-to-write-a-syscall documentation.

Instead of the values in /proc/.../attr/current you'd get the
values from /proc/.../attr/prev.

I'm thinking that a syscall lsm_self_attr() would get all of the attributes
that are available from /proc/.../attr today. Flags would identify what
kind of attribute they are:

	LSM_ATTR_CURRENT	0x0001 /* Current security context */
	LSM_ATTR_PREV		0x0002 /* Previous security context */
	LSM_ATTR_EXEC		0x0004 /* Exec security context */
	...
	LSM_ATTR_SOCREATE	0x0020 /* Socket creation context */

As you suggest above (with a touch of modification) lsm_self_current()
gets just the LSM_ATTR_CURRENT values, lsm_self_exec() gets the
LSM_ATTR_EXEC values. It would be easy to add new attributes and implement
library functions to filter them out rather than have to create new
syscalls every time a new attribute is added.

It might also be useful to have a flag value (See? You were right) for
the syscalls LSM_ATTR_INTERFACE_LSM which instructs the syscall to only
return the attribute values for the interface_lsm. Hmm. How about allowing
the caller to specify which security module they want the values for by
LSM ID? That could be useful although certainly not necessary. It could
make the user space processing more efficient. It would make converting
libselinux and libsmack to use the syscalls a little bit easier. I'm not
wedded to the LSM ID filter as the caller can always ignore data from
security modules it doesn't care about.

What about lsm_self_attr_set()? This seem rife with peril. Setting a group
of security attributes on a process could fail halfway through and then
require unwinding the preceding successes. I could see having this syscall
if it was only allowed to set a single attribute at a time.

lsm_pid_attr() would be like lsm_self_attr(), but would take a process id as
an additional parameter and get the values for the specified process. This
could make a bunch of dbus' /proc accesses unnecessary. It would have to be
quite a bit more complicated than lsm_self_attr() because it would have to
verify that the caller has appropriate access to the target process. We can
debate whether Smack can deny access to another process' SELinux context.
We can also debate whether an incomplete operation (you can get the SELinux
context, but not the AppArmor context) is an error.

I am going to start playing with these syscalls. Please help me understand
where I have suggested something stoopid.

Thank you.
