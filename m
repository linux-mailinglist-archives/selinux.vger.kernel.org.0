Thanks for providing more performance information, this is helpful.
Right now as I look at the results, I'm trying to decide if I care at
all about the chain length information as ultimately the latency is
really what we care about, yes?  I'm also trying to reconcile the
chain length information with the latency information; based on the
difference in chain lengths I would have expected more of a difference
in the latency numbers.  As you mention the latency numbers are
basically the same (give or take two clock cycles) between the two
hash implementations, assuming we exclude the worst case.  If we
include the worst case the old implementation is better, at least in
the data you've provided.

Is the added complexity of the hash3 implementation, as compared to
the current avc hash, stealing from the performance improvement
brought by the improved hash table utilization?  If true, I would
expect the penalty to be constant regardless of the chain length, but
it seems like the latency difference between old and new gets worse
(from a "new" perspective) as the chain length grows.  Can you explain
that?  Or are we simply playing in the noise of the measurement since
we are only talking about a clock cycle or two?

Oh, one nit against the first patch - you might as well use all
lower-case letters in the stats (e.g. "q1" not "Q1" and "med" instead
of "Med") to be consistent with the existing output.

So with the avtab we see similar chain length numbers between the two
hash implementations but we manage to save a couple of clock cycles
across the board from best to worst.  I'm guessing this is almost
surely due to the simpler hash3 implementation over the current avtab
implementation, yes?

I'm not one to throw stones as my spelling is terrible, but I wouldn't
be doing my job if I didn't ask you to run spellcheck on the comment

We can get rid of the "mask" field, right?
