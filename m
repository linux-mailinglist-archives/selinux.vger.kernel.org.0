Done. The currently running build is still running on the old server,
future builds should already run on the new one.

Also, you'll want to read Bill's email, which unfortunately doesn't

https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/CAFftDdo-jFy4anQaVvQqtYgjRvG8w-TNNLOUU5JL11gQF_rCpQ@mail.gmail.com/

since the linked announcement only mentions travis-ci.com, but I'm
sure they'd come for us sooner or later, anyway...)
