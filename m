Thanks a lot for the detailed information Paul.
Its very helpful, and we appreciate it.

We will base on SeLinux -> next branch, as you/Mimi suggested.

Based on our testing so far, there aren't any merge conflicts.
But if the need arises, we'll do our best to help you resolve/review
them.

Mimi has been actively reviewing IMA side of the changes for this
patch-set.

Lakshmi has written an SeLinux test for this feature, and it is
currently being targeted for LTP repo.
https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp

We can work with you to also get it incorporated in selinux-testsuite.
But the concern here is we may have to pull additional dependent scripts
from LTP to selinux-testsuite to support our test.

Could you please take a look at Lakshmi's SeLinux test, and guide us
further on this? Here is the patch.

Will do. Thanks.

Thanks for the pointer.
We'll go through the documentation.
