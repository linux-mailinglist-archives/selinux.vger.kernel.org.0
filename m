DESCRIPTION

Linux Security Summit Europe (LSS-EU) is a technical forum for
collaboration between Linux developers, researchers, and end-users.  Its
primary aim is to foster community efforts in analyzing and solving Linux
security challenges.

 The program committee currently seeks proposals for:

   * Refereed Presentations:
     45 minutes in length.

   * Panel Discussion Topics:

   * Short Topics:
     30 minutes in total, including at least 10 minutes discussion.

   * Tutorials
     90 minutes in length.

Tutorial sessions should be focused on advanced Linux security defense
topics within areas such as the kernel, compiler, and security-related
libraries.  Priority will be given to tutorials created for this conference=
,
and those where the presenter a leading subject matter expert on the topic.

Topic areas include, but are not limited to:

   * Kernel self-protection
   * Access control
   * Cryptography and key management
   * Integrity policy and enforcement
   * Hardware Security
   * IoT and embedded security
   * Virtualization and containers
   * System-specific system hardening
   * Case studies
   * Security tools
   * Security UX
   * Emerging technologies, threats & techniques

  Proposals should be submitted via:

   https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-europe/program/=
cfp/

DATES

  * CFP close:            July 31
  * CFP notifications:    August 10
  * Schedule announced:   September 1
  * Event:                October 29-30

COVID-19 SITUATION

Currently LSS-EU is planned as in-person event, however this would be
re-evaluated closer to the event itself and if the situation in Europe does
not permit such events, it would be switched to a virtual event, similarly
as this year=E2=80=99s LSS-NA.

WHO SHOULD ATTEND

We're seeking a diverse range of attendees and welcome participation by
people involved in Linux security development, operations, and research.

LSS-EU is a unique global event that provides the opportunity to present an=
d
discuss your work or research with key Linux security community members and
maintainers.  It=E2=80=99s also useful for those who wish to keep up with t=
he latest
in Linux security development and to provide input to the development
process.
