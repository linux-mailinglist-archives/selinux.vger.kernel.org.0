The difference is: with the new flag, we count and ignore exactly those
errors that would abort the processing (the file tree walk) in case
SELINUX_RESTORECON_ABORT_ON_ERROR were specified.

This is based on Petr's comments in RHBZ#1794518.

The whole idea is: stick with non-aborting, but *also* don't fail the
whole function in case you had aborted with ABORT_ON_ERROR. Because
right now, even though we don't abort, we still fail the whole function.

The latter, definitely.

I noticed that immediately, but that's not something I want to get
into... ;)
