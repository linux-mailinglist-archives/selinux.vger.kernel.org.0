>>> It can certainly split it up per LSM.  But can it then take the apparmor portion of the context and pass that to existing libapparmor interfaces without breakage?  Or will the changes to the format described above create issues there?

The trailing '\n' is handled conditionally so only if its there; this is well tested as the currently out of upstream af_unix socket mediation that is used by dbus does not include a trailing '\n' on the SO_PEERSEC.
