Ok, I pushed up two more changes - one to fix a memory leak in the
previous change (thanks kmemleak!) and one to update the security
blobs of the open files of the current process when it unshares its
SELinux namespace. This gets us a bit farther; now when I setenforce 1
in the new SELinux namespace, it retains access to its
stdin/stdout/stderr but it segfaults because it loses access to its
memory mappings. I see the Huawei patch set had something to try to
migrate the VMAs of the current process; that looks ugly and doesn't
have a convenient helper in the mm subsystem unlike the open files
situation (iterate_fd helper that was already being used by
flush_unauthorized_files). So that's the next challenge. Might be
better though to just defer the unsharing of the SELinux namespace to
the next execve, similar to setexeccon(), so that we don't have to
deal with it.
