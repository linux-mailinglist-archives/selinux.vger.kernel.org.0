It looks OK semantically when compared to my merge. I only see
reordering/comment/whitespace differences.

The whitespace misalignment introduced by Jeff's patch is still there
in your branch. Personally, I'd prefer that we fix them now rather
than deferring it to a future patch, because it seems that no one ever
has time to bother sending whitespace fixup patches :) But I'll
understand it if you prefer not to touch it more than necessary, so I
won't fight about this further.
