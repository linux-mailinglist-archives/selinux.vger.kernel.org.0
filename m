Definitely CC linux-audit as I expect Steve will want to have his say.
FWIW, "lockdown_reason" seems reasonable to me.

It's a balance between development needs and freaking out
administrators (although perhaps rightly so).  I also worry a bit that
WARN can be disabled at build time so having something like
SELINUX_ERR could be a good fallback, assuming we did both.
