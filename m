This is a compound problem. Some applications, including systemd and dbus,
will require modification to completely support multiple concurrent LSMs
in the long term. This will certainly be the case should someone be wild
and crazy enough to use Smack and SELinux together. Even with the (Smack or
SELinux) and AppArmor case the ps(1) command should be educated about the
possibility of multiple "current" values. However, in a container world,
where an Android container can run on an Ubuntu system, the presence of
AppArmor on the base system is completely uninteresting to the SELinux
aware applications in the container. This is a real use case.

I have chosen to use /proc interfaces for the stacking work for several
reasons. First and foremost, there are a painfully large number of system
applications that will never be modified to support multiple concurrent
LSMs, but that can be used successfully with the interface_lsm "hack".
Another is that it will take years to get a significant number of the
applications that can be changed updated. No one is even going to start
on that until kernel support is upstream.

> I think it's time to think about a proper set of LSM syscalls.

At the very least we need a liblsm that preforms a number of useful
functions, like identifying what security modules are available,
validating "contexts", fetching "contexts" from files and processes
and that sort of thing. Whether it is built on syscalls or /proc and
getxattr() is a matter of debate and taste.

You can't script syscalls. A syscall interface is fine if you can also
update the entire system service application base for your distribution.
I don't see that as an option.

I agree, but unless the new system calls take stacking into account
from their inception they're just going to be another interface that
makes stacking harder to accomplish.

The /proc interfaces interface_lsm and context are really pretty simple.

The addition of multiple subject labels to audit would be the same regardless
of /proc or syscall interfaces. We'd still need multiple LSM data in most
security blobs. The conversion of LSM hook interfaces from secids to lsmblobs
would still be required. As would the conversion from string+len pairs to
lsmcontext structures.

A liblsm based on the /proc interfaces would address that as well.
Just as libselinux abstracts the /proc interfaces now.

> Thoughts?

I wish you'd suggested this three years ago, when I could have done
something with it. If stacking has to go on a two year redesign because
of this it is dead. We've spent years polishing the /proc interfaces.
Changed the names, the content, even bent over backwards to accommodate
the security module that refused to adopt an attr/subdir strategy.

I'm not objecting to this proposed API. I am objecting to the idea that
stacking can't progress without it.

   const char *ctx_str;

or even

   const char *ctx;

err, and there are problems with passing this to a syscall.

Easy to implement in liblsm by parsing /sys/kernel/security/lsm.

Your lsm_ctx struct won't do here. Where do the context strings go?
You can't have an unallocated pointer in a structure you pass to a syscall. 
This is the problem that led to the "lsm\0context\0lsm2\0context2\0"
version of attr/context.

... and you can fill this from /sys/kernel/security/lsm and
/proc/self/attr without using interface_lsm, so it can be implemented
today.

So while I agree that syscalls might be better, they are unnecessary
to support application updates. A liblsm that uses the file based interfaces
that are already there will work as well.
