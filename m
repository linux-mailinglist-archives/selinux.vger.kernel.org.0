[Apologies for top posting]

Hi,

Thanks for thinking of that, but it's not necessary; you have been the one =
doing the work and updating the text, I'm just providing some review and fe=
edback :)

I see you posted an updated draft - thanks. My time is limited this week, s=
o I may not be able to properly review it until next week, but Stephen, Pet=
r, and James have agreed to help maintain The Notebook in GitHub so they ma=
y be able to help provide some review and/or merge the patch.
