Yes, when I was testing and didn't have SCTP support, the test suite
would fail and propagate back.

No, and I did a bunch of additional runs, like 10-12 and never saw additional
failures. I see some of those intermittent travis CI failures with all
my projects
on Travis, but I don't see this as adding any more issues. Timeouts are caused
by nothing sent to stdout for 10 mins (IIRC), so we should be good there.

Im just waiting on Ondrej, he said he had some feedback and I was gonna send
round 3. If I don't here anything back on Monday ill send round 3.
