Oh ignore that, that's a particular artifact of using automake's test
log compiler
for my particular project. You won't see that in stdout so on failure to see
the details of each test run I have to do that.

Yep, exactly.

I was thinking initially that -k caused make to return 0 not 1, and
that -k was the
root cause. That's not the case as you pointed out, so I think we can
ignore that
part. I think N errors in a make build are fine, so long as the rest
of it doesn't
attempt to run.
