My guess is that the binder folks don't view this as a backwards
compatibility issue since you have to enable binderfs first.  I'm
honestly not sure how many distro kernels, outside Android, enable
this anyway; the secnext kernels explicitly patch the Rawhide kernel
config to enable binder.

When in doubt, I think it is better to assume that there are *no*
tests.  Unfortunately It has been my experience that this holds true
more often than not.
