Fedora recently decided to pull in various libsepol patches from
master[1]

My policy has broken down in various way's. Some changes make sense but
some others I have issues with.

An example of something I never expected to be allowed in the first
place is re-declarations of blocks and recent changes exposed some instances
where I declared blocks multiple times and got away with it.

However I also encountered issues that i am not sure how to deal
with.

re-declarations of macros are no longer allowed:

Take this example:
https://github.com/DefenSec/dssp5/blob/dev/src/dev/termdev.cil

Here I inherit a set of macros from the
"file.all_macro_template_chr_files" template and then I override some of these
macros by manually re-declaring them with slighty different content (the
xperm rules are appended).

This use to be allowed but I am no longer allowed to redeclare macros.

This would not necessarily be a big problem IF this would instead work:

But the above in-statements cannot be resolved.

This is not the only instance where this approach does not work. I also
have templates that declare blocks. I use to be allowed to re-declare
these blocks so that I could add to them but this is no longer
allowed. However these blocks also cannot be resolved outside of the
templates, so I cannot use "in" to reference them.

It seems as if the "in" blocks are resolved before the "blockinherit"
blocks are expanded.
