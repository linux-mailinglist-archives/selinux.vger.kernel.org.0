Perhaps this is misguided, but it seems like avc_init is deprecated
and along with it the ability to even set a custom thread callback.
IOTW there does not appear to be a mechanism to set a thread callback
while using avc_open (only avc_init). Perhaps we can just get rid of
the default callback for avc_open and allow the (deprecated) avc_init
to continue using it as it does?

Is this basically what you were proposing for #2? I think I'd be more
inclined to go with that approach, in case userspace object managers
are doing other things in their thread callback.
