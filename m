I think this is a case where the separation of the security server
from the Linux integration code is not doing us any favors.

While not taking a policy lock does seem a bit awkward here, I agree
that given the way the code is structured we are pretty much stuck
with doing the locking in the selinuxfs code ... which it appears is
what you've done in v5.  I'm dealing with limited network access at
the moment, and the merge window is still open, so I'll defer a proper
review of v5 until after the merge window closes but if the mutex
removal is the only significant change I don't suspect there will be
any significant comments.
