Based on a (very) quick look, it seems like full_name_hash() shouldn't
really be any worse than partial_name_hash() with the advantage of
being a bit faster in some cases and cleaner from a code perspective
so it's a win from my perspective even if the performance remains
completely the same.

I haven't seen any objections so I'm going to merge it now.

Unfortunately I'm pretty swamped at the moment digging out of
maintainer backlog stuff so it might take me a while to get to
properly reviewing this, but I'll add this patch to the todo pile.

Christian, would you happen to have any time or interest in reviewing
Linus' patch and giving it a good test?

[Side note for Linus, yes, we do have a somewhat simple test suite for
quick regression testing, if you're interested have a look at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-testsuite]

That's fine by me.  I can't say it bothers me to the same level as
you, but I will admit to having my own annoyances, I think we all do.

Thanks again for the patch.  I'm going to post it quickly to the
SELinux list as an inline patch so patchwork will pick it up and it
doesn't get lost in my inbox, feel free to ignore the repost.
