True. A useful optimization.

Ordering or the lack thereof is not critical to the issue.

Without question. But you really only need the labels identified in
the policy, right? SELinux has to be able to deal with a combination
of categories that it hasn't seen before already.=20

That's true with UIDs and GIDs as well. Except for UID 0, of course,
but that's special in user namespaces. I'm also not convinced that
the policies in the child namespace are really going to deviate from
those in the parent that greatly. Writing a system level SELinux policy
(or Smack rule set, for that matter) is *hard*. Sure, I can see running
an Android policy in a container on a RHEL system, but the mapping has
to be done once by someone in the community, not for every deployment.
And at that, most of the policy will be common.

I realize that the issues aren't trivial. But to dismiss a technology
because you can't apply a specific set of optimizations to it in a
specific case just ain't right.
