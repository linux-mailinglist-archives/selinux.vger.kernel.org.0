I'd like to keep the reference to targeted model etc, so how about:
"The policy allows system administrators and users to continue using
working methods that they learned before becoming familiar with SELinux, 
because of its "targeted" model and reasonable defaults."?

Yes, I'll add one.

Indeed, for example removing "unconfined" module is great source of fun. 
It's not impossible but needs a lot of supporting policy work.

Thanks, I'll ad that.

Yes, though it will be less work than making a comprehensive whole 
system policy from scratch. I think I'll make three different chapters:

Custom Policy Modules
Network Labeling
Fully Custom Policy

Thank you for the review! I'll post an updated version soon.
