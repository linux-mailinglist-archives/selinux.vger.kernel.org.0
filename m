Basically what I meant was that you cannot do the following since the
source and target type are the same and there is no way to specify the
socket other than if it were a UDS (a socket file):
type_transition init_t init_t:tcp_socket app1_socket_t;
type_transition init_t init_t:tcp_socket app2_socket_t;

I'll look at the code you reference but my experience is that the
socket systemd is listening on is labeled init_t despite, as in your
example above, the executable being labeled properly and transitioning
to the type that I've specified, in the type_transition rule in the
apps policy module, when it is run by systemd.
