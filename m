The LSM infrastructure provides a framework for hooks
and allocation of blobs. That's it. It's a layer for
connecting system features like VFS, IPC and the IP stack
to the security modules. It does not implement any policy
of it's own. We are not going to implement SGX or any other
mechanism within the LSM infrastructure.

What you need to do is move all the lsm_ema code into its own
place (which could be security/enclave). Manage your internal
data as you like. LSMs (e.g. SELinux) can call your APIs if
needed. If the LSMs need to store SGX information with the file
structure they need to include that in the space they ask for in
the file blob.

That's up to the individual security module to decide.

You are managing the ema map lists. You don't need the LSM
infrastructure to do that.

). BTW, it is alloced/freed automatically by LSM infrastructure in securi=
ty_enclave_load()/security_file_free().

Do you mean security_enclave_load()/security_enclave_free() ?
There is no way you can possibly have sane behavior if you're
allocation and free aren't tied to the same blob.

You are both right that it doesn't belong in the SELinux code.
It also doesn't belong as part of the LSM infrastructure.

Yes. Aside from allocation and deletion the infrastructure does
nothing with the blobs. The blobs are used only by the security
modules. All other data is maintained and used elsewhere. SGX
specific data needs to me maintained and managed elsewhere.

Good example. You'll see that there is no audit code in the
LSM infrastructure. None. No audit data, either. It's all taken
care of in the audit system.
