I believe the kernfs nodes for the cgroup2 files that have host labels
are initially being created by the kernel before the Android policy is
loaded and therefore still inherit the parent directory xattr which
was based on the host policy. Not sure if there is something further
we can do in the kernel to avoid this. I tried moving the Android
policy load earlier (before the unsharing of the cgroup namespace) but
that didn't appear to help. Need to track down exactly when these
kernfs nodes are created and whether they are shared across multiple
cgroup2 mounts.

In my testing, if the host is permissive, then I see a mix of host and
Android labels (i.e. system_u:object_r:cgroup_t:s0 and
u:object_r:cgroup_v2:s0) but if the host is enforcing, then they are
all shown as Android labels but the ones that had the host labels when
permissive are shown as u:object_r:unlabeled:s0. This makes sense
since if the host is permissive and we are running as root (with
CAP_MAC_ADMIN), the kernel will return raw contexts/xattrs on
getxattr(2) even if they can't be mapped to a valid context in the
current policy; otherwise the kernel will return the unlabeled context
as defined by the current policy. I found that on the host, the new
cgroup tree is visible under /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-NNNN.slice
and on the host, it is similarly a mix of cgroup_t and unlabeled_t
(unlabeled_t for the ones with Android labels since they can't be
interpreted by the host).

If/when you get around to moving to enforcing mode, you may need to
either augment the Android policy with additional allow rules on the
unlabeled type to permit access to the top-level /sys/fs/cgroup files
where needed. We can't relabel the files from within the Android
container because its policy doesn't support userspace labeling of
cgroup2 files, and relabeling from the host to the Android labels
would be tricky even if possible - would require that the process
performing the relabel have CAP_MAC_ADMIN + SELinux mac_admin
permission to set the xattr to an unknown label and even then I am not
sure that would propagate to the actual cgroup2 inode within the
Android container until it is evicted/refreshed.

In any event, I'll toss those three patches on top of my
working-selinuxns branch but may revisit them later - the last one is
a bit of a hack and needs further thought, and the first two may have
performance implications that we should mitigate in the case of only a
single SELinux namespace.
