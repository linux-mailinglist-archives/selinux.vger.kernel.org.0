My two cents FWIW is that being able to see whether you actually 
relabeled via exit status is way more useful than having to parse output 
to get at that info.  There's no need for the complexity of the wrapper, 
no opportunities for parser bugs, and you can just directly succeed/fail 
a systemd unit or bash script based on the return code.
