BTW Busybox urgently could use some modernization. It might not even
work fully anymore with recent kernels. For example its a user space
object manager (for the passwd class) and it does not use
selinux_check_access()

Theres also just generally a lot old stuff that has been improved since

It still works on Linux 5.4 (I use it with OpenWrt) but compiling it
floods the screen with "deprecation notices". Most notably for
selinux_context_t

If and once OpenWrt moves to Linux 5.9 (new LTS) some functionality may
no longer work
