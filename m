Good, let's just do that.

Yes, I thought about that too when looking at your patch yesterday and
trying to sort out why it was such a messy diff.

I'm fine with leaving policydb_destroy() where it is, but I agree that
separating the fix is likely worthwhile.  I'll go ahead and merge your
v1 patch into selinux/stable-5.3 (it's borderline -stable material
IMHO, but I'm pretty sure GregKH would pull it into -stable anyway, he
pulls everything with a "Fixes" tag it seems), and then merge the
reorganization patch into selinux/next.  Honestly, I can go ahead and
submit the reorg patch, it's basically already sitting in a tree on my
disk anyway, but if you would prefer to do it that's fine too, just
let me know.

I'll may also merge the v1 fix into selinux/next in order to fix the
inevitable merge conflict, but that isn't something you have to worry
about.
