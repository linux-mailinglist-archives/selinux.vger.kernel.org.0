My original understanding of library ABI compat requirements came from
Ulrich Drepper's paper,
https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf

Looks like Debian's policy is here:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#run-time-shared-libraries

IIUC, if we follow the rules laid out by both, removing an old symbol
version entirely is incompatible and requires a SONAME change.  That
said, commit c3f9492d7ff05bdc8581817655ad05bc1e1174b8 ("selinux:
Remove legacy local boolean and user code") was technically an
incompatible change; it left the symbols in place but made them always
fail or ignore no-longer-used parameters, which isn't truly
compatible, and we didn't change the SONAMEs then.

I'd personally be ok with not changing the SONAME as long as these
interfaces were only ever used by the selinux userspace code itself or
only by really ancient code that is no longer in use by any supported
distribution but I don't think that flies with e.g. the Debian policy.
