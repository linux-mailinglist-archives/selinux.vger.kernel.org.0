While I have concerns about reusing the socket:connect permission for
the ASCONF updates, it isn't because of the peer_secid.  The
peer_secid represents the security label of the remote peer and it is
the subject label for ASCONF operations.

Two thoughts in random order:

* Policy capabilities would be needed as we currently apply the
socket:connect permission to cover the ASCONF updates.
* We should list out all of the current ASCONF parameter changes and
have a discussion about which ones we want to protect with access
controls, and of those remaining controls which should be grouped (if
any).

Are you talking about something like this: "allow socket_t
self:sctp_socket some_asconf_perm"?  I'd need to hear a good
explanation for this and why we would need this control, because it
doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  If you are allowing an application
to create a SCTP socket, you are granting it permission to make use of
SCTP, including ASCONF.
