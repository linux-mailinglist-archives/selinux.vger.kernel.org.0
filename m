No clue.  My knowledge was gleaned from the code and from Stephen's
feedback.


The high level breakdown:

  - FILE__EXECUTE: required to gain X on a mapping to a regular file


  - FILE__EXECUTE + FILE__WRITE: required to gain WX or W->X on a shared
                                 mapping to a regular file

  - FILE__EXECMOD: required to gain W->X on a private mapping of a regular
                   file

  - PROCESS__EXECMEM: required to gain WX on a private mapping to a regular
                      file, OR to gain X on an anonymous mapping.


Translating those to SGX, with a lot of input from Stephen, I ended up
with the following:

  - FILE__ENCLAVE_EXECUTE: equivalent to FILE__EXECUTE, required to gain X
                           on an enclave page loaded from a regular file

  - PROCESS2__ENCLAVE_EXECDIRTY: hybrid of EXECMOD and EXECUTE+WRITE,
                                 required to gain W->X on an enclave page

  - PROCESS2__ENCLAVE_EXECANON: subset of EXECMEM, required to gain X on
                                an enclave page that is loaded from an
                                anonymous mapping
                       
  - PROCESS2__ENCLAVE_MAPWX: subset of EXECMEM, required to gain WX on an
                             enclave page
