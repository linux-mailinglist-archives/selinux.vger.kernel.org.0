I just wanted to point out that the work Giuseppe is doing is to support 
nfs homedirs with container runtimes like Rootless Podman.


Basically fuse-overlayfs on top of NFS homedir needs to be able to use 
user xattrs to set file permissions and ownership fields to be 
represented to containers.

Currently NFS Servers do not understand User Namespace and seeing a 
client user attempting to chown to a different user, is blocked on the 
server, even though user namespace on the client allows it.  
fuse-overlay intercepts the chown from the container and writes out the 
user.Xattr the permissions and owner/group as user.Xattrs.  And all the 
server sees is the user modifying the xattrs now chowning the real UID 
of the file.
