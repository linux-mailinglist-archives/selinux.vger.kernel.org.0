This is not even remotely comparable to the Big Kernel Lock... 99.9%
of the time, there will be just one sidtab, otherwise there will be
just two for a short time during the policy reload, which need to be
updated in sync anyway.

I wish it were that simple, but it won't work this way. Consider a
scenario like this:
1. Thread A acquires the old policy pointer, encounters a new context,
adds it to the old sidtab as X, but doesn't start adding it to the new
one yet.
2. Thread B acquires the new policy pointer, encounters a different
new context and adds it to the new sidtab as X.
[Now you end up with two different contexts assigned to the same SID,
depending on the policy]
3. Now thread A continues to add the context to the new sidtab, but
since it reuses the count variable from before, it overwrites the
entry for X.
(And even if you fixed that, re-searched the new sidtab, and added the
new context to the end, you'd end up with the context having different
SIDs under the old vs. new policy, which is again a messy situation.)

You see, moving the sidtab code around can get you in trouble and
that's why I'm advocating for using a common lock - it's much easier
to prove that such change doesn't create new bugs. And as I said
above, merging the locks won't really have performance consequences,
so I still believe it to be the better choice here.
