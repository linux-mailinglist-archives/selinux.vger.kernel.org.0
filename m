I did take a look at it and it looks good.
I tried my best to create a reply to the list, but I was unable to
make any of the suggestions work.
See: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230816123845.80171-1-cgzones@googlemail.=
com/

If someone could reply to the first email of the series and cc me,
then I can add my ack.

Unless someone has a better suggestion.

Thanks,
Jim
