The point I wanted was that it shouldn't be Fedora vs Debian (or any
"distro A" vs "distro B" for that matter); we should be working
towards supporting all the major distros equally well.  I'm under no
illusion that this is going to happen overnight, but I think it is
something we should keep in mind as we move forward.  Individual
developers are always going to have a favorite distro (and many of the
developers here are paid to support a given distro - I don't want to
threaten anyone's livelihood), so I recognize some distros may always
get the new features first - and that's okay - but let's not forget
the other distros too :)

Thanks.
