selinuxfs_exists is declared as just int, not external int, and
gets filtered out with awk one-liner within the original script.

I've spotted select/pselect and have paid some attention to
zeroing the diff *but* overlooked the <stdin> filter in the
script from libselinux-2.9 tagged tree I started looking at.
Evgeny suggested doing something about the changed source
marker format either, shame on me for distracting.

Will this one do better?  Looks a bit messy though[1]:

gcc -E -I../include -xc ../include/selinux/selinux.h |
  awk -F '[ (]' '/^#/{p=0} \
    /^# .*selinux\/selinux\.h/{p=1} \
    /^extern int/{if(p==1){print $3}}'

Good test for those who have it handy, my primary intent was
to be able to at least build without (not-yet-ported) gcc.

Thank you for the review and suggestions, please have a look
at the proposed handler replacement; if it's ok I'll arrange
it as a commit and hopefully figure out the test tomorrow,
getting sleepy by now...

[1] start/end patterns don't cut it for me given repetitions:

sed -n '/^# .*selinux\/selinux\.h/,/^#/{s/^extern int \(\w*\) *(.*$/\1/p}'

skips e.g. security_deny_unknown given gcc's output
but works fine with somewhat differing lcc's one.
