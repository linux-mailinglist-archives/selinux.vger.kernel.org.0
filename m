Good point about the installer. I have already started working on
preparing Fedora for the runtime disable removal, but so far I'm only
at the beginning. Updating anaconda to add selinux=0 to the kernel
params instead of using /etc/selinux/config will be one of the main
steps.

I also prefer to rather go somewhere in this direction rather than
introducing the delay. I was kinda OK with the delay at first, but as
Stephen points out, it would punish users rather than distros, even
though users are (normally) not the ones that make a conscious
decision to use the runtime disable.

Yes, I was under the impression that some changes in libselinux are
needed before this works transparently, but apparently it already does
the right thing now. In that case I'd say that it may be better to
skip adding sleeps etc. and just remove the feature at some point. But
please let's wait with that for a while longer so we can prepare
Fedora for it first. It's hard to tell at this point how long that
will take, but it could be several months.

Then again, the sleep might be helpful to wake up potential non-Fedora
users (if any) and in Fedora we can always apply a revert as a
downstream patch until things are sorted. So if you guys really want
it, I think we can deal with it.

We definitely don't plan on backporting it to existing major RHEL
releases. However, I'd like to prepare Fedora for a life without the
runtime disable (and to disable the kernel config option as the final
step) before the next major release is branched off of Fedora, so any
future major releases will hopefully already ship with SELINUX_DISABLE
turned off/removed.
