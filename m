The uid mappings for user namespaces are simplified by the fact that
uids are totally ordered so you can express the mapping compactly
using ranges.
Even for MLS/BLP, labels are only partially ordered and in TE, there
is no order at all among types.
Defining a complete mapping of all SELinux labels (to include all
possible category sets with all possible sensitivities with all
possible types...) would be huge.
There may not even be any one label in any of the policies in question
that can serve as the "ground truth" label that can be stored in the
filesystem xattr and mapped to a label in every other policy.
