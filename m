Looks good aside from man page comments below.

Unless this pointer and structure are exposed to users of the shared
library, I don't know why we'd document them in the man page.  The
struct definition is only needed for direct users of selinuxfs that
don't go through libselinux (if any), and that would logically go into
a selinuxfs man page if we ever created one of those.  You can refer
to the SELinux status page as a general mechanism similar to the
SELinux netlink socket without exposing library internals here.

Likewise these are libselinux-internal functions not exposed to users
of the library and hence wouldn't appear in the man page.

Can omit "into selinux_status".

Does the avc_open.3 man page need updating too?
