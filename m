I think I made the mistake of getting too carried away with
implementation details rather than just getting to the point.  And I
misremembered the ECREATE flow -- oops.  Let me try again.  First,
here are some problems with some earlier proposals (mine, yours
Cedric's):

 - Having the EADD operation always work but have different effects
depending on the source memory permissions is, at the very least,
confusing.

 - If we want to encourage user programs to be well-behaved, we want
to make it easy to map the RX parts of an enclave RX, the RW parts RW,
the RO parts R, etc.  But this interacts poorly with the sgx_mmap()
alignment magic, as you've pointed out.

 - We don't want to couple LSMs with SGX too tightly.

So here's how a nice interface might work:

int enclave_fd = open("/dev/sgx/enclave", O_RDWR);

/* enclave_fd points to a totally blank enclave. Before ECREATE, we
need to decide on an address. */

void *addr = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_NONE, MAP_SHARED, enclave_fd, 0);

/* we have an address! */

ioctl(enclave_fd, ECREATE, ...);

/* now add some data to the enclave.  We want the RWX addition to fail
immediately unless we have the relevant LSM pemission.   Similarly, we
want the RX addition to fail immediately unless the source VMA is
appropriate. */

ioctl(enclave_fd, EADD, rx_source_1, MAXPERM=RX, ...);  [the ...
includes SECINFO, which the kernel doesn't really care about]
ioctl(enclave_fd, EADD, ro_source_1, MAXPERM=RX ...);
ioctl(enclave_fd, EADD, rw_source_1, MAXPERM=RW ...);
ioctl(enclave_fd, EADD, rwx_source_1, MAXPERM=RWX ...);

ioctl(enclave_fd, EINIT, ...);  /* presumably pass sigstruct_fd here, too. */

/* at this point, all is well except that the enclave is mapped
PROT_NONE. There are a couple ways I can imagine to fix this. */

We could use mmap:

mmap(baseaddr+offset, len, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED | MAP_FIXED,
enclave_fd, 0);  /* only succeeds if MAXPERM & R == R */

But this has some annoying implications with regard to
sgx_get_unmapped_area().  We could use an ioctl:

ioctl(enclave_fd, SGX_IOC_MPROTECT, offset, len, PROT_READ);

which has the potentially nice property that we can completely bypass
the LSM hooks, because the LSM has *already* vetted everything when
the EADD calls were allowed.  Or we could maybe even just use
mprotect() itself:

mprotect(baseaddr + offset, len, PROT_READ);

Or, for the really evil option, we could use a bit of magic in .fault
and do nothing here.  Instead we'd make the initial mapping
PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC and have .fault actually instantiate
the PTEs with the intersection of the VMA permissions and MAXPERM.  I
don't think I like this alternative, since it feels more magical than
needed and it will be harder to debug.  I like the fact that
/proc/self/maps shows the actual permissions in all the other
variants.


All of the rest of the crud in my earlier email was just
implementation details.  The point I was trying to make was that I
think it's possible to implement this without making too much of a
mess internally.  I think I favor the mprotect() approach since it
makes the behavior fairly obvious.

I don't think any of this needs to change for SGX2.  We'd have an
ioctl() that does EAUG and specifies MAXPERM.  Trying to mprotect() a
page that hasn't been added yet with any permission other than
PROT_NONE would fail.  I suppose we might end up needing a way to let
the EAUG operation *change* MAXPERM, and this operation would have to
do some more LSM checks and walk all the existing mappings to make
sure they're consistent with the new MAXPERM.

As an aside, I wonder if Linus et all would be okay with a new
MAP_FULLY_ALIGNED mmap() flag that allocated memory aligned to the
requested size.  Then we could get rid of yet another bit of magic.
