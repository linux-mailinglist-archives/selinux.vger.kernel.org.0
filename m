As cil_verify_name does not modify db (and would be seen as a function
which does not modify anything and only checks some rules), it would
be better to add a const qualifier:

    int cil_verify_name(const struct cil_db *db, const char *name,
enum cil_flavor flavor)

Other than that, the documentation of the new option,
"--qualified-names  Use qualified names." make me feel like the
wording can be improved. More precisely, a commit message contains
"Using qualified names means that declaration names can have dots in
them" and this definition should also be in the documentation. So I am
suggesting to replace the documentation with:

    Allow names containing dots (qualified names). Blocks,
blockinherits, blockabstracts, and in-statements will not be allowed.

Other than that, when I tested "secil2tree -A resolve -o test.cil
secilc/test/policy.cil && secilc -Q test.cil" I encountered other
errors, which are not related to these patches. When modifying the
resulting "test.cil" to make it compile (by removing blocks and
renaming some objects), option -Q worked fine. It would be nice if
such a command was integrated in secilc's tests, in order to prevent
future regressions. Nevertheless such work can be done once this
series is merged.

Cheers,
Nicolas
