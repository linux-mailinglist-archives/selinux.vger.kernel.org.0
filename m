Interesting, thanks.  Regrettably the make test cases in the userspace
tree are fairly limited (and can't be too extensive if they are going
to keep working on travis-ci since they cannot presume SELinux in the
host).  In practice, I usually also test changes to the userspace by
running the selinux-testsuite, which exercises rebuilding policy and
confirms various runtime behaviors that are not exercised by the
userspace make test, and by rebuilding refpolicy (or Fedora policy
would also work) and comparing against what the previous version
yielded.  We also likely ought to be re-testing setools upon changes
to the userspace and vice versa.  They are all rather intertwined.
