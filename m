This example does not make sense to me

1. you shouldnt be allowed to inherit a block that is not abstracted:
(block b) does not have a (blockabstract b)

2. the a typeattribute is not associated with any types and so the
compiler would filter it out since its useless

I tried it out here and surprisingly the compiler does not fail, but no
policy ends up in the result, so I do not know how you get to those results
