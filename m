A couple of things and I understand that this isn't the place to
discuss systemd issues so please forgive me.

Dominick, I'm not sure what should be done about your argument that
systemd shouldn't be able to create, accept, ... sockets, open a bug
on RHEL policy?

Christian, I looked at the systemd code and see why the bound socket
is init_t, it is because I use the SELinuxContextFromNet so that my
service runs at the level (MLS) of the peer.
socket_determine_selinux_label checks to see if the
SELinuxContestFromNet option is set and if so eventually calls
getcon_raw (there is a misleading comment that reads in part "get
label from network label") which I don't think is the right thing to
do. Instead I think socket_determine_selinux_label should first check
the policy db to see if a port type has been set and if so use it.
