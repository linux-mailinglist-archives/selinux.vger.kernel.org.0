Adding a magic Makefile target which is later removed for a variable
using $(filter-out $<,$^) makes things a little bit more complex, but
I can agree with this.
On the other hand, since I began packaging SELinux libraries for Arch
Linux, I found several releases that needed to bump such a dependency
version. For example, if I remember correctly libsemanage 2.4 requires
libsepol>=2.4, same for 2.5, 2.6... but libsemanage 2.9 could work
with libsepol 2.8 (I usually tries building with older versions when
packaging a release for Arch Linux, and the history is available for
example on https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/log/?h=libsemanage).

This being said, what about adding some logic to force libsemange
version X.Y to depend on libsepol>=X.Y and libselinux>=X.Y? The
version is already available in libsemanage/VERSION and this file
could be used to implement such a check.
