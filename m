I tried this out:

1. yes you can create dirs on cgroup2 fs (but not files)
2. you can have a genfscon "cgroup2" alongside fsuse trans "cgroup2" but
if you do then any genfscon statements you might have like for example
genfscon "cgroup2" "/user.slice" cgroupfile_context) no longer
work. i.e. its pointless to have then both
3. even with a fsuse trans statement I could not make type transitions
work for directories created on cgroup2 fs.

Even if you could create directories on a cgroupfs with a type
transition, and if the files under that directory would inherited the
type of the parent, then that still would not be good enough to address
the memory.pressure file challenge because the point is to allow a
service to write the memory.pressure file but not other files in that
same directory.
