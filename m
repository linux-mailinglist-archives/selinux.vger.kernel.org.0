indeed, this has to be tightly controlled. Much more so than just
creating a namespace. And its not just the "security/LSM" namespace
but the entire context around it. That is whether or not you can
step into say the mount namespace separate from the security/LSM
namespace it was created with.

Each and everyone of those opens potential attack surface. Even if you
if it turns out to be safe, you have to carefully evaluate each
potential combination.

actually I think that is pretty much the goal, just a minimal thin
layer that provides the hooks and maybe an LSM blob object for the
individual LSMs to do their thing.

Instead of each LSM implementing their own interface there is a common
one for container orchastrators to use to make the request.

yep, this is really just about a thin common API, and minimal
infrastructure around the existing system namespacing calls (clone,
ushare, setns).

A trust orchestrator isn't necessarily needed. Each LSM can manage its
own trust within its policy. A trust orchestrator becomes more necessary
when you are trying to namespacing without the LSMs themselves
participating in the decision around namespacing. Which admittedly has
largely been the current situation.

Its not needed if individual LSMs are making decisions around namespacing
based on policy. In fact in that case it can even be harmful. Per LSM
policy would be finer grained, where a capability becomes this shared
flag that lacks context. Examples abound in the kernel where we have
a cap check without context and then a more context based security
check.

Where the capability might be useful is wehn LSMs aren't dealing with
the namespacing request directly.

I disagree with the reuse of CAP_MAC_ADMIN, if there is going to be
a capability around this it should be distinct from MAC_ADMIN and
MAC_OVERRIDE, as it very much has different semantics.

yes. I might have mentioned just how much I dislike setns().
