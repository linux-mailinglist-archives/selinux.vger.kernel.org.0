No worries on that, there's no rush as we are early in the cycle.

It'd be too late to mask it out, as it may already have been assigned.
And on top of that, it would introduce a weird scenario where the
application thinks that creds have been assigned and it completes
successfully, but in reality it didn't use the specified creds. For
those cases we absolutely must fail the request, as it didn't do exactly
what it was asked to.

It's always better to catch weirdness or ambiguities like this early, so
much appreciated!
