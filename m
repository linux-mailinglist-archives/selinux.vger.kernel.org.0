I'll have to dig a bit in history to fully recover the original
motivation/background but IIRC, this had to do with kernel-internal
sockets created and used by the kernel on behalf of userspace.  For
example, sockets associated with NFS mounting and subsequent RPC. In
these cases, we don't necessarily want to allow the userspace process
to directly create/use such sockets and from the userspace
perspective, it is just acting on NFS files and not performing any
socket I/O. Open to doing it in a better way, or finding out that it
is no longer necessary.
