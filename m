This issue is a little bit more subtle to solve, because blockabstract
can include composed names (I'm not sure whether this is the right
word for this concept). For example in
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/5b05e829da0863f3538be8d153373adec7fc07f6/secilc/test/policy.cil#L330-L333
:

(block z
  (block ba
    (roletype r t)
    (blockabstract z.ba)))

This part of the CIL compiler is quite complex and I am not sure when
I will be able to understand it enough to propose a fix.
