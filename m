Post-install script in Debian package checks for both removed and 
disabled modules and tries to keep the state same after package upgrade. 
Is this not the case for other distros? I haven't had problems with 
upgrading the package with lots of removed modules.

Right, "need to be supplemented".

Those are great too. Though there's also Appendix C and many manual 
pages would also benefit from examples.

Yes, more examples would be great. I'll try to add some more here.
