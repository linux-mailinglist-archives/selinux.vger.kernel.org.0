I don't have any problems with the idea. However, where I got stuck
with the original selinux namespace patches was not per-namespace
filesystem security xattrs (which was James' contribution) but rather
the need to support per-namespace in-core inode and superblock
security blobs. You'd have to go back to my original posted patch
series or the older selinuxns branches of my github repo to see my
attempt at supporting those because they were dropped from the
working-selinuxns branch due to the ongoing reworking of LSM to handle
blob allocation by the security framework rather than by the
individual security modules. I couldn't figure out how to make that
work safely and efficiently, and AFAICT that still has to be addressed
for the above idea to work.

Yes, this also seems sane to me and works well for e.g. sharing
read-only OS images across containers.

So with my earlier patch set (the one in my older selinuxns branch),
one could already do the equivalent of selinuxns_outer just using the
existing context=3D mount option. This is because it allowed for
per-namespace superblock security blobs, so you could context mount in
the parent namespace while still selecting per-file labeling in the
child. That said, it had the issues I referenced above wrt safety and
efficiency. For selinuxns_owner, I'm not clear on where/how that would
be used. Note that the context you assign to files will quite often
differ from the context assigned to the processes; hence, if
selinuxns_owner is meant to be the context of a process, it usually
won't be the same as selinux_outer.
