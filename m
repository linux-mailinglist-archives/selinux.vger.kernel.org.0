Agreed.  I wasn't sure if you wanted the support for files, or other 
buffer measurement scenarios, except critical data.  So I started the 
implementation with supporting just critical data.  Happy to extend it 
to files and other buffer measurement scenarios as you suggested.

Agreed.  Earlier I wasn't sure if you wanted allow_dup support for all 
the scenarios.  Now that it is clear,  I will implement it as you 
suggested.  Thank you so much for the pointers.  Appreciate it.

Thanks,
