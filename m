I agree that this is a challenge.  I *think* our model handles it 
cleanly, although we haven't had the "stress test" that implementing a 
full system policy in it will undoubtedly provide and I'd be surprised 
if we don't come across some interesting scenarios we haven't given 
enough thought to.

A lot of this is handled with the @associate annotation which allows for 
automatic deriving and access of the child.  In your example, I would do 
something like:

virtual resource init_pid {
	@associated_call
	fn use_init_pid(domain source) {
		this.manage(source);
	}
}

@associate([init_pid])
virtual domain init_daemon_domain {
	syslog.write(); // defined elsewhere
}

domain my_service inherits init_daemon {}

The key thing here with respect to what we're discussing is that when we 
inherit from init_daemon_domain we get a *copy* of all of 
init_daemon_domain's associated resources, and the @associated_call hook 
is called for each child on the copy.  So in this situation, my_service 
would inherit the syslog permissions (and the init domain elsewhere 
could reference all init_daemon_domains), but in terms of the policy 
that becomes unique to each child, that is defined in the 
@associated_call annotated function (and there can be multiple such 
functions if you desire), and it's called under the hood for all the 
children.

This conversation has also reminded me that we intended to have an 
@noinherit annotation for things that wouldn't be passed on to the 
children.  For example, there may be scenarios where it's beneficial to 
have init_daemon_domain associate with a resource and have the children 
*not* get copies of such a resource.  That particular feature got lost 
in the shuffle, so I may need to loop back on it.

Even without that though, I think the association mechanism here hits 
the key points on this challenge, and covers at least the common cases 
pretty cleanly.  Let me know if you think something is missing here.

I agree pretty much 100% with everything you've said here about the 
usage and historical limitations of optional.  Thanks for the added 
historical context from before my time.

On the topic of packaging, I'll admit that I'm sparse on details without 
an actual implementation at this point, so the packaging aspect of 
Cascade is currently vaporware, but my hope is that an integrated 
packaging and build system framework, inspired by rust's cargo can solve 
a lot of the packaging problems much more cleanly (by inserting optional 
blocks for install order problems during compilation rather than in 
source for example).

I like the suggestion of a question mark operator for optional policy 
quite a bit.  Although I'm really interested in exploring whether it's 
possible to just treat the entirety of it as a policy level dependency 
resolution problem.  Basically annotate with modules a particular module 
depends on vs which are optional - the distinction being that the 
optional marking is done at the module level rather than the 
rule/interface call level.  That might be less heavy-weight and error 
prone to use while still providing the needed flexibility.

Opinions are what I'm seeking. :)  And yes, I think all of your thoughts 
here are quite helpful.  I think the attributes concern is a good one 
that we aimed to address, and can continue to refine as needed, and the 
optional thoughts are extremely helpful, since as I mentioned in my 
prior e-mail, the overall support for differentiating which policy is 
required and which is optional is a must-have in my view, but how 
exactly to specify it in a way that is clear is somewhat challenging and 
subjective.  Added info on historical context and use cases is a 
valuable input to that discussion.
