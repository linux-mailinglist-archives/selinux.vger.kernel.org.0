I don't think we can switch to nodev since we have been exposing that
null device node forever and
we know of at least one user (Android).  Android started with a
complete fork of libselinux but went
back to following upstream, although they still retain their own
custom additions.  So I think at most we
could add noexec/nosuid here with no risk of userspace breakage.
