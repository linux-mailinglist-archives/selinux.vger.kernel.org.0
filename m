Memtest86+ has proven that the system in question had a damaged motherboard, 
any time when any DIMM socket other than socket 1 was in use Memtest86+ would 
lock up solid in less than 7 seconds (for reference a complete Memtest86+ run 
was successful at the time the system was deployed).  The system is on the e-
waste pile and I don't expect to see such semodule problems again.

How the system in question managed to boot Linux and run multiple VMs while 
Memtest86+ crashed so soon remains a mystery to me.
