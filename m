(Note: I'm going to call the capability CAP_RESTORE but I think this
applies regardless of whether the permissions stay with CAP_SYS_ADMIN..)

I haven't fully reviewed the discussion of the security consequences but
my sense is this would require retaining CAP_RESTORE down the entire tree
of processes being restored so each parent could call clone3() with the
correct pid value for its child(ren).

Ideally you would drop CAP_RESTORE sooner -- preferrably only one
process would need it. I think you could do that by changing what you pass
down; instead of passing down a capability and a pid number, pass down a
special "reservation" pidfd:

1. Have CAP_RESTORE enable opening a pidfd with the desired pid as a
   reservation for the pid (i.e. can't use it to signal, wait, ...
   perhaps these return -EBUSY, -EAGAIN or something...).

2. Only one process needs CAP_RESTORE -- it can drop CAP_RESTORE after
   reserving all of the pids but before kicking off the clone3() calls
   to recreate all of the tasks.

3. Pass the pidfd down the tree of restoring processes. Note how the
   set of specific pids to be created is limited at this point --
   the software cannot be tricked into recreating processes other pids
   using a capability, CAP_RESTORE, it doesn't have. You might even set a
   flag on the pidfd which closes the pidfd in the sender when it's passed
   over a socket so that only the appropriate processes retain the pidfd.

4. The parent can then pass the *reserved* pidfd into clone3(). The
   reserved pidfd seamlessly turns into a pidfd reference to the child if
   clone3() succeeds. If it fails the eservation is still consumed -- a
   given pidfd reserved for clone3() can only be passed to clone3() and
   succeed once.

Perhaps this scheme could concentrate the need for CAP_SYS_ADMIN
to one process so maybe it would obviate the need for CAP_RESTORE.
That said, perhaps there's something that prevents implementing such
a pidfd or perhaps I have misunderstood what CRIU is doing and this
pidfd idea isn't workable.
