Hi Al,

I will admit to glossing over the comment above when I merged this
into the selinux/dev branch last night.  As it's been a few weeks, I'm
not sure if the comment above still applies, but if it does let me
know and I can yank/revert the patch in favor of a larger pull.  Let
me know what you'd like to do.
