I'm fairly sure that people have been using the unknown label support
for livecd creation successfully for quite some time. Have they just
been doing it with CAP_MAC_ADMIN enabled or otherwise as root?

Yes, I'm not sure if this is a compelling example. For Android I just
built the support for labeling files into the filesystem image
generation tools themselves so that it could produce a fully labeled
filesystem without ever needing to mount it on the host. I think the
Yocto meta-selinux tooling also migrated toward that kind of an
approach, although I could be wrong.
