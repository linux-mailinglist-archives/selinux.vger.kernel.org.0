It does not necessarily have to be unconfined_t.

I took some time to try and come up with an example that goes to the
essence. For this i used the example tiny cil-policy from the SELinux
notebook. You would need `secilc`, `seinfo` and, `sesearch` to try it
out yourself:

curl \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-notebook/main/src/notebook-examples/cil-policy/cil-policy.cil \
> cil-policy.cil

secilc -vvv cil-policy.cil
seinfo policy.33

this is "tiny CIL policy" it can be used for demonstration.
it has a single type "sys.isid":

seinfo policy.33 -t

and it has only one security class that has two access vector permissions
associated with it namely: "process { dyntransition transition }"

seinfo policy.33 -xc

the single type "sys.isid" has "unconfined" access:

sesearch policy.33 -A

this is essentially the simplest example of an "unconfined" domain.

lets add a new type, and new security class and some permissions. to demonstrate what
it takes to have a unconfined domain in an environment that has more than just one
type, one security class and two permission.

I will do it in stages.

echo '(type mytype) ;; a new type' >> cil-policy.cil
echo '(class myclass ( myperm1 myperm2 )) (classorder (unordered myclass)) ;; a new class with two new permissions' >> cil-policy.cil

secilc -vvv cil-policy.cil
seinfo policy.33
seinfo policy.33 -t
seinfo policy.33 -xc
sesearch policy.33 -A

now type sys.isid is no longer an unconfined domain because it does not have access
to "myclass { myperm1 myperm2 }". The new "mytype" type has no permisssions associated with it at all.

to make sys.isid unconfined again we have to:

1. (allow sys.isid sys.isid (myclass (myperm1 myperm2)))
2. (allow sys.isid mytype (myclass (myperm1 myperm2)))
3. (allow sys.isid mytype (process (dyntransition transition)))

this is a bit hard to manage. we can use type attributes to group types:

echo '(typeattribute mytypes) ;; a new type attribute' >> cil-policy.cil
echo '(typeattributeset mytypes (sys.isid mytype)) ;; all our types are associates' >> cil-policy.cil

secilc -vvv cil-policy.cil
seinfo policy.33 -xamytypes

now the above 3 rules can be written in a simpler way:

echo '(allow sys.isid mytypes (myclass (all))) ;; access to effectively: * myclass *' >> cil-policy.cil
echo '(allow sys.isid mytypes (process (all))) ;; access to effectively: * process *' >> cil-policy.cil

secilc -vvv cil-policy.cil
seinfo policy.33
seinfo policy.33 -t
seinfo policy.33 -xc
sesearch policy.33 -A

I think this is probably the simplest example of an unconfined domain.
type attributes can be used to "organise your policy"
if you plan your policy well then eventually making a "domain" unconfined could be as
easy as associating it with a type attribute.

sesearch policy.33 -A -t sys.isid -t mytypes -dt
seinfo policy.33 -xa mytypes

for example we could create a type attribute called "unconfined_access" and associate
all access vectors with it:

(typeattribute unconfined_access)
(allow unconfined_access mytypes (myclass (all)))
(allow unconfined_access mytypes (process (all)))

then to make type "mytype" unconfined as well; simple associate it with unconfined_access

(typeattributeset unconfined_access (mytype)))
