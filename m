Long before we developed CIL I had experimented with parsing Refpolicy
with a lua program that I created. I was really worried about memory
usage when developing that, so I did not copy anything. When it was
proposed to copy the AST for CIL I was sceptical and reworked my lua
program to see what the impact would be. It turned out to be easier to
do, faster, and did not require any more memory. The memory lost due
to copying the AST was made up by not having as many symbol tables.

If a lot of the macros that are being inherited are not used, then it
might be worthwhile to add a step to remove unused macros. Of course,
to really save the memory usage only the macros that are going to be
used should be copied, but I don't think that would be easy to do.

I will admit that I am not a big user of inheritance. What is gained
from inheriting all of the macros like that?

Thanks for the report. I will take a look to see if there might be a
fairly easy way to improve the situation.
