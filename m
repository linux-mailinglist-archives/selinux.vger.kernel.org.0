Overall I really like the idea.

The use case which would be complicated (not blocked) by this, is

* a runtime creates a process p1
  * p1 unshares its lsm namespace
* runtime forks a debug/admin process p2
  * p2 wants to enter p1's namespace

Of course the runtime could work around it by, before relinquishing
control of p1 to a new executable, returning the lsm_get_self_attr()
data to over a pipe.

Note I don't think we should support setting another task's namespace,
only getting its namespace ID.

A part of me is telling (another part of) me that being able to setns
to a subset of the lsms could lead to privilege escapes through
weird policy configurations for the various LSMs.  In which case,
an all-or-nothing LSM setns might actually be preferable.

I haven't thought of a concrete example, though.
