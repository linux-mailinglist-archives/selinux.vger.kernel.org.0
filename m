We'd have to fail open then, I think, and return an S_PRIVATE inode
(the regular anon inode).

I'm not sure what counts as overuse.

The purpose of this change is to apply special policy to userfaultfd
FDs in particular. Isn't having a UFFD security class the best way to
go about that? (There's no path.) Am I missing something?

I was also thinking of just providing some kind of context string
(maybe the name), which might be friendlier to modules, but the loose
coupling kind of scares me, and for this particular application, since
UFFD is always in the core and never in a module, checking the fops
seems a bit more robust and doesn't hurt anything.

Where? Any chance it would be ready soon? I'd rather not hold up this
work for a more general mechanism.

I think someone mentioned on the first version of this patch that we
could make it more flexible if the need arose. If we do want to do it
now, we could have the anon_inode security hook accept a "parent" or
"context" inode that modules could inspect for the purposes of forming
the new inode's SID. Does that make sense to you?
