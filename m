Yes, I agree. Looking back at what I did with the patch and
communication I can see I went the completely wrong way about it and I
apologize.

Actually there is really no good reason for me not to simply add the
extra changes as a separate patch/commit... I guess I just
instinctively tried to keep the one logical change in one patch and
didn't think it through properly... I'll scratch that embarrassing
commit and just post the extra changes as another patch.
