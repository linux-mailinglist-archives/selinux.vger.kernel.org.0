Thanks for taking a look and reviewing the idea.

The multiple xattr approach is okay-ish if you need *something* to get
past the labeling hurdle so you can work on other aspects of the
implementation, but it is not a viable solution upstream.  The scaling
and management difficulties make it a non-starter in my opinion.

I didn't get into any implementation details because I was still
wrestling with the design issue of how do we deal with only a single
on-disk label.  In my mind that needed to be solved before we could
spend time thinking about how to implement it in a reasonable manner.

Regardless, you bring up a good point: there are still a number of
implementation challenges with namespacing SELinux.  There is the
issue of supporting multiple labels on kernel entities such as
superblock, inodes, tasks, etc., but I have a hunch that the more
challenging issue is going to be the various LSM/SELinux external
"things" that deal with a single secid/secctx.  We will have to see
how things develop with the LSM stacking effort, but that might end up
helping us in that area, we'll have to see how that goes.

Agreed, supporting multiple different views of an entity and mapping
that a namespace in a quick and efficient manner is probably going to
be one of the larger technical challenges.  I won't pretend to have a
answer for this yet, but I do believe we can figure something out.

I'm open to other ideas on how to make this work, but I do think it is
important to separate a context mounted filesystem that is shared
across multiple namespaces from a "selinuxns_outer" (or whatever we
want to use) mounted filesystem that appears like a context mount to
the mounting namespace while supporting native labeling for a child
namespace.  If there is a clever way to do that with existing mount
options that's even better.

My idea behind the "selinuxns_owner" owner was to provide an easy way
to identify which domains in the mounting/parent namespace would have
the ability to enable native filesystem labeling in their own child
namespace.  It seemed like a reasonable way to simplify the SELinux
namespace API by not needing to specify all of the mounted filesystems
that the child namespace would have labeling control over when the
child namespace was initiated.

That came up in some offline discussions too.  When I was kicking
things around in my mind it was easier to reason about things,
especially nested namespaces, if the child namespace was represented
by a single type in the parent namespace.  Unfortunately that
simplification ended up leaking out into my email.  If it makes things
easier to read/understand, I would recommend simply removing that
sentence from my email, it shouldn't affect the design either way.
