I'm still debugging this.  My first belief that the bug was fixed in the latest 
git seems incorrect.  I've now got a collection of valgrind logs from libsepol 
from git revision 5447c8490b318ef64c61eb6022baddca69233733 (latest as of 
yesterday afternoon).  I presume that the valgrind logs of "Conditional jump 
or move depends on uninitialised value(s)" corresponds to a SEGV when not 
running valgrind but haven't proven that yet.

I have not yet worked out how to reproduce the bug on another system.  
Nickolas, thanks for all your suggestions I will go back to them once I have 
more test results.
