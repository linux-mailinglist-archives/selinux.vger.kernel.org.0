Great, thank you.

One of the challenges to network testing is that you don't always know
how other network stack implementations are going to react when you
start getting into corner cases or lesser implemented protocols.  You
just need to test your patches to make sure nothing breaks.

I have a responsibility to ensure that we provide a stable, secure,
maintainable kernel that is as bug-free as we can possibly make it.
If I see a patch that I believe warrants a certain type of test to
help meet those goals I'm going to ask for that testing.  Of course
like many things, even things we believe to be very clear, there is
always going to be a chance that disagreements will happen around what
testing is relevant or necessary.  How you handle that disagreement is
a choice you will need to make for yourself, but I would encourage you
to consider that more testing is usually a good thing, and aggravating
those who review/ACK your patches is generally not a good long term
strategy.
