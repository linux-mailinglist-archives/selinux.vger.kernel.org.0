We do still run the selinux-testsuite nightly on Fedora Rawhide with
your kernel-secnext kernel builds (I suppose we fetch them from COPR).
I can't really describe what we do when they fail, because that hardly
ever happens now :) But if we came across a failure that would suggest
a bug, we would certainly investigate and report it.

The testsuite is now also being run as part of CKI
(https://github.com/cki-project), which AFAIK currently runs regularly
on linux-stable kernels (the results are posted publicly to
stable@vger.kernel.org). I don't follow these reports closely, so I'm
not sure if there were any non-false-positive failures there...

I think the main reason why I didn't include NFS server starting was
that I don't know how to do it robustly across distros... Already on
RHEL the service name varies ("nfs-server" vs. just "nfs") and then
there is "service xyz start" vs. "systemctl start xyz"...
