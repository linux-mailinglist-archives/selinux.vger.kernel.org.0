Looking at checkpolicy.c, it looks like it only generates POLICY_BASE
or POLICY_MODULE policy types. I currently limit the optimization only
to POLICY_KERN type, because from comments in policydb.h I got the
impression that other policy types have different structure and I'm
not sure if they need some special handling. I don't have that much
knowledge about SELinux userspace code yet... if you can give me some
hints about the difference between the various POLICY_* types, then I
will be happy to make some adjustments if they make sense.

Yes, I think I'm handling the dontaudit rules incorrectly... For some
(historical?) reason they actually specify the permissions that *are*
audited, although the semantic of combining multiple rules is still
that a permission is dontaudited if there is at least one dontaudit
rule for it, so the logic of handling the raw perms data has to be
inverted for AVTAB_AUDITDENY entries. I had noticed earlier that
AVTAB_AUDITDENY rules are handled differently but somehow I concluded
that the perms values should still bitwise-or together...

Can you please try it with adding:

if (specified & AVTAB_AUDITDENY)
    return (d1->data & d2->data) == d2->data;

to the beginning of match_avtab_datum() in optimize.c? (patch form
here: https://github.com/WOnder93/selinux/commit/17c77e4bb8857ebfff9b32e2e0bc800e206aba1e.patch)
