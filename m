Ah, really helpful pointers, thank you very much!

My assumption was that I can use the greatest lower bound, and then
preform a `setexeccon` and `exec` to transition to the new security
context provided I can pass the open fd according to policy (for
now -- at least until I can find a better way to restrict a thread -- I'll
do some reading in mod_selinux / xinetd). Is this the case, or am
I going to wind up in a world of hurt?

The use-case here is to allow an RPC server to listen to network
traffic, and when properly authenticated, raise the sensitivity level
and category as required, both so the RPC server can logically
handle access controls (not shocked the crunchy folks hit this first)
as well as a system level protection in case there's a slip up and
the server attempts to read a secure file (less urgent but still
very nice to have!).

I'm very much still learning the MLS ropes here, so if someone
sees me hurtling to the edge of a cliff, do let me know!
