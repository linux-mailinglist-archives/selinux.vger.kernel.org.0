Sometimes strange things happen during development and code review :)
It happens so rarely, and not recently, that I can't say what
triggered it - it may have been me manually cleaning up some files due
to odd directory state - but it *has* happened, and we might as well
make the Makefile do the right thing.

Agreed.  If you had replied sooner I would have been okay with merging
a patch before the merge window opens, but with the merge window
opening in a few days I'm not going to merge anything that isn't
critical.  Yes, the risk is low, but the advantage gained is even
lower.

I can send a patch after the merge window closes, or you can do it; I
don't care much either way.
