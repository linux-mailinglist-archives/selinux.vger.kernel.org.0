I think I understand a little bit what your issue might be now, and if
correct then I believe the focus should be on initial labeling of the filesystem.

I see, i guess that is rootfs and that it is not labeled initially.
In OpenWrt generally a (readonly) squashfs us used (to boot from) with
overlayfs. The squashfs is labeled at built-time and the root directory of the overlay as well.

I guess that if you want to use rootfs, that you would have to address
initial labeling somehow.

It might help if you tell us a bit about the filesystems used in your
system.
