Thanks for performing those measurements.

I apologize that I haven't had an opportunity to review your patcheset
in detail just yet (I've been struggling with some self-inflicted
networking issues this week), but looking strictly at the numbers
above it appears that by every metric in the table this patchset
results in a policy that is larger (both on-disk and in-memory) as
well as performance that is at best the same (although in most cases,
it is worse).  Are there any improvements expected beyond test
configuration [4] (above)?
