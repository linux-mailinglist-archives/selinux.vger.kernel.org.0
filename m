It's something I've considered doing as part of the stacking work,
but that I have eschewed in the spirit of churn reduction. I've no
problem with it.

The flags approach works for me. I was going to propose adding a call
audit_lsm_secctx() that LSMs would call to identify that a secctx was
being supported, but I had considered the flag approach as well. As for
ugly, I can't say one way or the other.

General comments:

Adjacent patches with no more commit message than "cleanup" should
be combined, as that message is telling me "these aren't the changes
you're looking for".

And about that. I believe that missing or uninformative commit messages
are on your list of things that displease you. You will need to improve
them to get them past yourself. :)

There's a lot of churn here due to unnecessary name changes. I can't
say they're unjustified, but the patch set is bigger than it needs to
be, and more disruptive.

I haven't tested it, but I don't see any substantial problems so far.
