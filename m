I don't think it's about easier or harder to clean up the mess, but a 
divide-and-conquer strategy. After all, SGX and LSM are kind of 
orthogonal as long as SGX doesn't compromise the protection provided by LSM.

Let's step back and look at what started this lengthy discussion. The 
primary problem of v20 was that the SGX module allows executable enclave 
pages to be created from non-executable regular pages, which could be 
exploited by adversaries to grant executable permissions to pages that 
would otherwise be denied without SGX. And that could be fixed simply by 
capping EPCM permissions to whatever allowed on the source page, without 
touching LSM. Of course the drawback is loss of functionality - i.e. 
self-modifying enclaves cannot be loaded unless the calling process has 
EXECMEM. But that should suffice, as most SGX1 applications don't 
contain self-modifying code anyway.

Then we could switch our focus back to LSM and work out what's relevant, 
especially for SGX2 and beyond.
