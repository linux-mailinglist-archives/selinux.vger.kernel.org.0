Yes to a unified interface, no to an LSM wide namespace. The interface
could request of the LSM to namespace, but its up to the LSM what it
will do. If it creates a namespace, whether that namespace is hierarchical,
or flat.

You would at the end of the call likely get a proxy object to a set of
individual LSM namespace contexts. Not that different than you have a
set of different system namespaces, mount, pid, user, ...

no each LSM will do its own thing wrt namespacing. The proposal is just
to provide a common API and minimal infra around it.

I have to agree with Paul that we won't generically agree on what an LSM
namespace should be.

Its not just these options though. The container manager may want to
"drop/add" an LSM.
Eg. one fedora/RH booting an Ubuntu container your host has selinux
the container wants apparmor.

In reality you have both selinux and apparmor active on the system,
but selinux is an enforcing state, and apparmor is in a no-policy
state.

selinux could deny creating the namespace, it could return its current
state, or it could mask itself by creating a namespace for the container
with the default unconfined_t policy, but its current state is still
there bounding the container, the container just doesn't see it.

On the AppArmor side at the request for a new namespace with apparmor
it needs to decide what to do independent of what selinux does. Yes
if configured correctly it should setup its policy namespace for the
container, but it has choices just like selinux that are driven
by policy as well as the userspace request for a specific combination
of LSMs for the cntainer.

host injecting policy into the container certainly could be supported
but I think that would be a per LSM thing.

attr/exec flags Paul was discussing (correct me if I am wrong), where
a way to specify which LSMs should but part of the unshare. So the
whole I want a container to support Ubuntu or RH and need these LSMs.

Per my above understanding the LSM_UNSHARE flag is then just a
namespacing that indicates you want to unshare the LSM and use the afore
mentioned attrs.

I don't think it is actually needed, but maybe desirable for consistency.
If you have already set the above attrs, that already indicates what
you want to do with the namespace at clone/unshare.

This then gets fed into every LSM (whether in the attrs or not). So they
can make current policy decision, and then if allowed, as second hook
with the info, so that they can each setup and return with their context
setup. Not really all that different from exec.
