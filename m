That's okay, you can admit you were trying to catch me not paying attention ;)

Thanks.  I'm sure I'm probably missing some detail, but if you get
stuck let me know and I'll try to lend a hand.

The current delay is intentional and is related to the io_uring work.

When Richard and I first became aware of the io_uring issue Richard
was in the process of readying his latest revision to the audit
container ID patchset and some of the changes he was incorporating, in
my opinion, hinted at the io_uring issue, or at least drew more
attention to that than I was comfortable seeing posted publicly.
Richard discussed this with his management and security response team,
and they felt differently.  I told Richard that I didn't want to block
him posting an update to the patchset, but that I felt it would be The
Wrong Thing To Do and if he did post the patchset I would likely
ignore it until after the io_uring fix had been posted so as to not
draw additional attention to his changes.  I can't speak for Richard's
mindset, but he appeared anxious to post his changes regardless of my
concerns, and he did so shortly afterwards.

That's why you haven't seen much progress on this for a while, and why
you will see me comment on the latest patchset after the io_uring
patches land in -next after the next merge window closes.
