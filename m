With regard to concerns raised in that thread:

1) For (soft?) real-time users, one option (if the latency introduced
by SELinux without a policy loaded is truly enough to affect their
workloads) would be to insert a if
(!selinux_initialized(&selinux_state)) return 0; at the beginning of
most hooks. However, we can't do that everywhere (e.g. we still need
to allocate/initialize security structures and maintain lists of
superblocks and inodes allocated before policy load so that we can
later fix up their labels during selinux_complete_init), and adding
such checks would make selinux_state.initialized an even more
attractive target for kernel exploits since it becomes another way to
"disable" SELinux entirely.  You can of course already target it to
disable policy checking but doing so tends to break certain things
like security_sid_to_context/context_to_sid on SIDs other than the
initial ones so it is not quite as attractive as enforcing currently.
This assumes that these real-time workloads are not so sensitive that
even the overhead of the indirect function call for the LSM hook
pushes them over their tolerance.

2) For cases where an error is returned by SELinux that is not already
governed by a selinux_initialized() or enforcing_enabled() check, we
just need to ensure that all such cases are gated by such a check. We
fixed that recently for the removexattr security.selinux case and
there were some earlier cases fixed with respect to setting labels
before policy load.  The specific concern raised in the thread
appeared to be due to denials silenced via dontaudit rules, which
won't happen if there is no policy loaded so I don't think that's
relevant.  There are other cases where SELinux might return an error
if a new case is introduced in another kernel subsystem without
updating SELinux to handle it, e.g. a new type for
selinux_perf_event_open(), a new obj_type in selinux_path_notify().
It would be better if we could introduce build-time guards to catch
these as we have done for e.g. new capabilities, new socket address
families, new netlink message types, in order to ensure that they are
always in sync.
