Pretty much, which is why I go back to, "If your setting CFLAGS, you better
make sure you get em right". There are so many options and so many things
that can affect the build output, you really need to get em right.
This is the one area autoconf/automake is nice (I have a hate/hate
relationship with it),
but it does give one easy-peasy feature test macros, so this problem
is simple to fix.

The problem with documentation is no one reads it :-p. We could do somethin=
g
like issue a warning, compiler agnostic, from make if we don't detect the
-fsemantic-interposition option (easy). That would be simple, or I can
work up the
gcc/clang split patches (slightly harder).

Or we can just say, if your messing with CFLAGS do it right and you should
probably add -fsemantic-interposition if your using gcc documentation (easi=
est).

If they didn't change the CFLAGS for their build, they wouldn't have this i=
ssue.
Which brings up the question, "can they add the flags they need to the
Makefile?"
or "What do they need added/removed/changed in CFLAGS overall?"

I'd like to start with why they need to change CFLAGS, and can we just
make that the default?
