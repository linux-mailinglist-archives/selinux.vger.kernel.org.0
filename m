Yes, I thought about that, but I wanted this diff to be as small as possibl=
e.
One option would be to wait until reallocarray is available (via
fallback or requirement (see later)) or keep the calloc+memcpy, but
not invoke the memset on a size of 0.

Looking for example at
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/commit/4859b738136ef8889fbb71a166=
cfec8d313ba4e0
(supporting gcc 4.8) I am not sure what compilers and standard C
libraries should be supported for building the SELinux userland
libraries and tools. Until any statement of the maintainer team, I
prefer the Makefile hack from
https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/20211011162533.53404-10-cgzones@googlemail.=
com/T/#u
to support standard C libraries without reallocarray(3).
