Hello,
It seems sad to transform a calloc call to an explicit multiplication
which can overflow. Nowadays glibc provides reallocarray, for a
"realloc with multiplication overflow checking". Could you use it here
instead?

I saw in another patch ([RFC PATCH 09/35] libsepol: use reallocarray
wrapper to avoid overflows ;
https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/20211011162533.53404-10-cgzones@googlemail.com/T/#u)
that you introduced reallocarray calls in other places, with a
fallback implementation for systems which lack it. When I saw it, I
was wondering: which C library does not provide this function?

- glibc has it since version 2.29 (according to
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html ; this version
was released on 2019-02-01)
- musl has it since version 1.2.2 (thanks to
https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/commit/?id=821083ac7b54eaa040d5a8ddc67c6206a175e0ca
; released on 2021-01-15)
- bionic has it since 2018
(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/b177085ce7219562eecf77f2e8de49f8f2605005%5E%21/)
- newlib has it since 2017
(https://sourceware.org/git/?p=newlib-cygwin.git;a=commitdiff;h=eb14d0cc649978c10928bf38c1847f295bf0de69)

However uclic-ng 1.0.39 (released ten days ago) does not provide
reallocarray. It is the only maintained and open-source C library
compatible with Linux that I could find which would not provide
reallocarray. Did I miss a library which is likely to be used by
libsepol users?

In my humble opinion, this means that for future releases we can
consider that systems are expected to provide reallocarray, and that
we can introduce a Makefile variable which would introduce a custom
internal reallocarray implementation in libsepol. This means that I
suggest using something like this in libsepol/src/Makefile:

USE_INTERNAL_REALLOCARRAY ?= n
ifeq (USE_INTERNAL_REALLOCARRAY, y)
  CFLAGS += -DUSE_INTERNAL_REALLOCARRAY
endif

and I suggest putting the internal reallocarray implementation from
your patch in libsepol/src/private.h (like you did), around "#ifdef
USE_INTERNAL_REALLOCARRAY" statements. This way, libsepol would work
out-of-the-box on most systems, would be compatible on systems without
reallocarray by using "make USE_INTERNAL_REALLOCARRAY=y", and would
not try to auto-detect it at build-time by some compiler magic in
Makefile (which would avoid issues similar as the one libapparmor had
in http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-October/294691.html).
What do you think of these suggestions?

Thanks,
Nicolas
