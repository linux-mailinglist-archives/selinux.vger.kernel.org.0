I think that's the same as #2 if I understood you currently.  That's
fine if you prefer it.
So then programs using avc_init() with non-NULL thread callbacks
(hence avc_using_threads == 1) will still create the netlink socket
and start a thread running avc_netlink_loop().  And programs using
avc_netlink_acquire_fd() will create the netlink socket if not already
created and can use it however they want.  Everything else will move
to using the status page.
