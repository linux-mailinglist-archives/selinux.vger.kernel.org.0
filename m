While I haven't looked at this patch in detail, I'm generally in favor
of cleanups and the encapsulation work has generally been a good thing
in my opinion.  It also should go without saying that fixing, or
improving, the atomic load issue would be a very good thing.

Without looking too closely at the call chains, or the allocation
sizes, I would vote for taking the lock in the name of consistency.
