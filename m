Originally, there was quite a bit of discussion as to how much or how
little should be measured for a number of reasons.  One reason is that
the TPM is relatively slow.  Another reason is to limit the size of the
measurement list.  For this reason, duplicate hashes aren't added to
the measurement list or extended into the TPM.

When a dentry is removed from cache, its also removed from IMA's iint
cache.  A subsequent file read would result in adding the measurement
and extending the TPM again.  ima_lookup_digest_entry() is called to
prevent adding the duplicate entry. 

Lakshmi is trying to address the situation where an event changes a
value, but then is restored to the original value.  The original and
subsequent events are measured, but restoring to the original value
isn't re-measured.  This isn't any different than when a file is
modified and then reverted.

Instead of changing the name like this, which doesn't work for files,
allowing duplicate measurements should be generic, based on policy.
