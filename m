That wasn't the proposal. The proposal was

"smack\0smack_label\0apparmor\0apparmor_label\0future_lsm\0future_lsm_label\0"

OK. Let's get'er done.

That's true for the string you included, but not for what I had

It's going to raise its ugly head again with SO_PEERCONTEXT for the
SELinux+Smack case. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Fair enough.

A LSM ID hard coded in a kernel header makes it harder to develop new
security modules. The security module can't be self contained. I say
that, but I acknowledge that I've done the same kind of thing with the
definition of the struct lsmblob. That isn't part of an external API
however. It may also interfere with Tetsuo's long standing request that
we don't do things that prevent the possibility of loadable security
modules at some point in the future. I will also mention the out-of-tree
security module objection, not because I care, but because someone most
likely will bring it up.

On the other hand, there's no great way to include two variable length
strings in a structure like this. So unless we adopt something as ugly
as the nil byte scheme this is supposed to replace I expect we're stuck
with an LSM ID.

For an API shouldn't this be a specific size? u32? I'm not really
up to date on the guidance regarding which it should be.

This is a workable interface. Certainly more friendly than the
nil byte format.

OK. I can see potential.

I will head in this direction. A couple questions:

Would we want lsm_prev_ctx() as well as lsm_current_ctx(),
or should we use the lsm_ctx->flags to identify the provided
context? If we did that we should have an lsm_ctx() system call
that returns the current, prev, and whatever other security
module specific attributes might be associated with the process,
each identified in the flags field. While the "current" context
is usually what we're after, there may be cases where the other
attributes are desired.
