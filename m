Can we not just assume that if that happens, that the kernel should just
treat the context as if it were the context of the unlabeled isid.

I mean that is what it boils down to anyway: everything always needs a
valid context. so might as well treat invalid contexts as unlabeled
isids? Not sure how "state" is relevant here as invalid is invalid.

Regardless, this current behavior makes things less robust. I wont
pretent that I am qualified to judge whether addressing this is
technically possible or not.
