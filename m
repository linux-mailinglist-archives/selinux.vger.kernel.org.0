Presumably it works when you are in permissive mode but fails when you
are in enforcing mode, or does it fail in permissive too?

If it works in permissive mode but you aren't seeing any AVC failures,
you may want to try removing the dontaudit rules from the policy.  You
can do that via 'semodule -DB' (the semodule(8) manpage has some
examples).

You may find that in the near term you need something like Fedora's
unlabelednet policy module which blanket allows unlabeled network
traffic to all the domains on the system.

It's not clear which interface you sniffed, was it the loopback
interface?  That is the only interface which should be doing any
explicit labeling; if you see CIPSO IP options on non-loopback
interfaces something is wrong.  I would also expect you to see CIPSO
options on the loopback traffic, do you?

As an aside, Wireshark does know how to parse CIPSO options so you
should be able to peek at them that way; although Wireshark does not
know about the "local" tag type we use on loopback (... and it
shouldn't, it's a horrible abuse of CIPSO, done intentionally <g>).

Try removing the dontaudit rules (above) and see if that helps with
the AVCs.  Let us know what you find.
