Which is wrong, because you have no idea who the semantic "recipient
task" is - any task that has a mapping of the binder fd can
effectively receive transactions from it.

(And the current "sender task" is also wrong, because binder looks at
the task that opened the binder device, not the task currently
performing the action.)

It would be, if you actually had a pair of tasks that accurately
represent the sender and the recipient.

Can you elaborate on why you think that?
