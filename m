Hm? That's not how whole-file hashing works. :)

These hooks need to finish their hashing and policy checking before they
can allow the rest of the code to move forward. (That's why it's a
security hook.) If kernel memory utilization is the primary concern,
then sure, things could be rearranged to do partial read and update the
hash incrementally, but the entire file still needs to be locked,
entirely hashed by hook, then read by the caller, then unlocked and
released.

So, if you want to have partial file reads work, you'll need to
rearchitect the way this works to avoid regressing the security coverage
of these operations.

So, probably, the code will look something like:


file = kernel_open_file_for_reading(...)
	file = open...
	disallow_writes(file);
	while (processed < size-of-file) {
		buf = read(file, size...)
		security_file_read_partial(buf)
	}
	ret = security_file_read_finished(file);
	if (ret < 0) {
		allow_writes(file);
		return PTR_ERR(ret);
	}
	return file;

while (processed < size-of-file) {
	buf = read(file, size...)
	firmware_send_partial(buf);
}

kernel_close_file_for_reading(file)
	allow_writes(file);
