Indeed, sorry for the brainfart.

I disagree. We shouldn't offer the user an easy way of shooting
themselves in the foot for no good reason.

The reboot will not fix the deletion of all files caused by a leftover
mount. If you don't want to harden the removal, then at least please
add a big warning to the prompt that the operation will also attempt
to delete files inside mounts mounted under /tmp. (But that's pretty
silly, when you could instead just add -xdev and avoid the problem
altogether...)

I would say the motivation is simply to force the re-creation of all
temporary files in /tmp so that any changes in type transition rules
are applied. It is illogical to remove also contents of mounts, as
these will likely use different labeling rules (depending on the
superblock or in case of a bind mount the original path). There is
just no way that deleting across mounts would be anything but a
horrible idea in this case.
