I hope it can :) I posted it as an RFC initially mainly to get some
high-level feedback whether I'm going in the right direction. But
based on your reply it seems it's already close enough to
acceptability that I could drop the RFC in the next revision. I also
didn't test it all that thoroughly, especially w.r.t. various
corner-cases...

That's a good question. Since this will be the first function in
libselinux with some internal parallelism, I guess I just didn't want
to affect the status quo of existing code too much... Indeed the lock
would be taken also in the single-threaded implementation, but since
in selinux_restorecon() selinux_log() is called only in non-hot paths,
I didn't bother optimizing that.

Anyway, I agree that making selinux_log() synchronized globally may be
a good idea. The cost should be minimal and it would prevent
accidental race conditions. If some reasonable quorum of maintainers
agrees, I will make that change in v2.

Hm, yes, I think I'll just add the cast to void there... Not a big fan
of the comma operator, but I couldn't resist the temptation to use it
here :)

Ah, thanks for pointing that out. I'll address it in v2.
