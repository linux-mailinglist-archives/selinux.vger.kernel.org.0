I am an idiot. The code makes a lot more sense now. You only want to
count an escaped character as one character.

I think that it is an invalid path, so maybe I need to add some sort
of verification to the path at some point.

I finally found the source of this code in
refpolicy/support/fc_sort.py where the function compute_diffdata() is
very similar. That function would increment str_len in this case, so
to be consistent with that fc->str_len should also be incremented.
