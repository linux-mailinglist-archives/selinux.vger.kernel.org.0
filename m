Drat, I meant to explicitly call that out in the cover letter.  Yes, the
concept of using sigstruct as a proxy was dropped for this RFC.  The
primary motivation was to avoid having to take a hold a reference to the
sigstruct file for the lifetime of the enclave, and in general so that
userspace isn't forced to put sigstruct into a file.

Correct, this approach requires up front checks.

Userspace will be able to understand when PROT_EXEC is actually needed
as mprotect() will (eventually) fail.  Of course that assumes userspace
is being intelligent and isn't blindly declaring permissions they don't
need, e.g. declaring RWX on all pages even though the enclave never
actually maps a RWX or RW->RX page.

One thought for handling this in a more user friendly fashion would be
to immediately return -EACCES instead of modifying @allowed_prot.  An
enclave that truly needs the permission would fail immediately.

An enclave loader that wants/needs to speculatively declare PROT_EXEC,
e.g. because the exact requirements of the enclave are unknown, could
handle -EACCESS gracefully by retrying the SGX ioctl() with different
@allowed_prot, e.g.:

  region.flags = SGX_ALLOW_READ | SGX_ALLOW_WRITE | SGX_ALLOW_EXEC;

  ret = ioctl(fd, SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_ADD_REGION, &region);
  if (ret && errno == EACCES && !(prot & PROT_EXEC)) {
      region.flags &= ~SGX_ALLOW_EXEC;
      ret = ioctl(fd, SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_ADD_REGION, &region);
  }

This type of enclave loader would still generate spurious audit messages,
but the spurious messages would be limited to enclave loaders that are
deliberately probing the allowed permissions.
