All right, so rather than try to change the programs, I added the
following TE rule:

allow sshd_t unconfined_service_t:tcp_socket { getattr setopt };

With that, sshd under tcpserver worked okay in permissive mode, with no
AVC notices in audit.log.  But when I changed to enforcing mode, the
program failed for no apparent reason (and again, no AVC messages).  
The remote system merely reported "Connection reset by peer".  Any idea
what's wrong?
