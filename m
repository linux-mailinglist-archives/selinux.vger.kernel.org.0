One of the selling points of the BPF LSM is that it allows for various
different ways of reporting and logging beyond audit.  However, even
if it was limited to just audit I believe that provides some useful
justification as auditing fork()/clone() isn't quite the same and
could be difficult to do at scale in some configurations.  I haven't
personally added a BPF LSM program to the kernel so I can't speak to
the details on what is possible, but I'm sure others on the To/CC line
could help provide more information if that is important to you.

The existing security_capable() hook is eventually called by ns_capable():

  ns_capable()
    ns_capable_common()
      security_capable(const struct cred *cred,
                       struct user_namespace *ns,
                       int cap,
                       unsigned int opts);

... I'm not sure what additional smarts would be useful here?

[side note: SELinux does actually distinguish between capability
checks in the initial user namespace vs child namespaces]

That assumes that everything you care about is behind a capability
check, which is probably going to be correct in a lot of the cases,
but I think it would be a mistake to assume that is always going to be
true.
