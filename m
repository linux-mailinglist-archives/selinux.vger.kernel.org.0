Even basic prefix match would allow elimination of many redundant 
entries.  WRT glob or regex matching, there are some examples in 
lib/glob.c (glob), kernel/trace/* (simple regex), and 
security/apparmor/* (dfa).  That said, I don't think this will avoid the 
need for some form of this patch as well.
