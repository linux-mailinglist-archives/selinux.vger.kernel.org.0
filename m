Stephen is, as is so often the case, correct. AppArmor has a stub
socket_getpeersec_dgram() that gets removed in patch 23. If I remove
it earlier and throw in a touch of scaffolding for secid_to_secctx()
we can leave the secid as is for now. This can't be the final solution
as AppArmor will be using the hook someday and we still have the all
modules case to worry about for the next phase. It also assumes that
The BPF module isn't going to suddenly sprout a security context.
