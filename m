We are already taking the isec->lock (or otherwise have exclusive
access to a newly initialized isec) in all the places where we are
updating the isec->avd and isec->avdsid. The issue is not the updates
but rather the reads in inode_has_perm() and
selinux_inode_permission(). Would prefer some lockless synchronization
there as otherwise I fear we are making things worse rather than
better. Need to ensure that the (isec->task_sid, isec->avdsid,
isec->avd) triple is consistent (i.e. that the isec->avd represents
the access vector decisions computed based on the isec->task_sid and
isec->avdsid) and that the (sid, isec->sid, avc_policy_seqno()) triple
matches the (isec->task_sid, isec->avdsid, isec->avd.seqno) triple in
order to use that avd.

Yes, can do that in the next revision.

The approach here is to call avc_get_avd() on isec
initialization/update and upon file open to cache the access vector
decisions at that time for later use upon inode_has_perm and
selinux_inode_permission. So avc_get_avd() is just
avc_has_perm_noaudit() w/o actually checking any specific requested
permissions. Like avc_has_perm_noaudit(), it first tries to look up
the entry in the AVC and only falls back to avc_compute_av() on a
cache miss. avc_get_avd() is not getting called during
selinux_inode_permission itself. If we don't call avc_compute_av() in
the cache miss case, then we'll have to do so at
selinux_inode_permission and inode_has_perm() time, in which case
we'll pay a higher cost there and that's the more performance-critical
path.

Agree, just wasn't needed until this change.
