Argh, as I was working through Andy's latest proposal I realized that I
was subconciously making FILE__READ imply FILE__EXECUTE.

The idea behind inheriting permissions from the source VMA is to exempt
"standard" enclaves from needing FILE__WRITE.  But if we don't add an
exemption for FILE__EXECUTE as well, then all enclaves need FILE__EXECUTE,
which means FILE__EXECUTE can't be used to identify the case where
userspace is mapping an inherited PROT_WRITE page as PROT_EXEC.  And if
the SGX magic exempts FILE__EXECUTE, then FILE__READ implies FILE__EXECUTE.

Yuck.
