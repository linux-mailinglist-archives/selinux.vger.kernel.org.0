correct but the reverse does work. Where SELinux is running on the host
and AppArmor in the container. Obviously that is the simplified version
AppArmor is running on the host too but unconfined, has setup a policy
namespace for the container and is self stacking (bounding).

I can live with that. AppArmor and Smack have already landed private
interfaces and prefer them over the shared interface if they are
available.

I don't think its a foregone conclusion, its just that it has been
discussed several times, and all the interfaces have been nasty and
prebaked userspace code would be really nice to have.

There are other reasons to use a lib as well. Libs can help apps
pickup fixes/changes automatically.

I do wish we had a better API from the beginning. I just hope it isn't
going to take another 10 years to get the API portion done.

what I think Paul is saying is we can move the LSM stacking patches
forward by removing the combined label interface. They won't be as
useful but it would be a huge step forward, and the next step could
be the syscall API.
