The main goal of this patchset is to bring the possibility to use prefix
or suffix matching in filename transitions, as now it is not possible to
cover files that have fixed prefix and variable part after it. For
example devices in /dev (the policy now enumerates all possible number
suffixes) or files with random suffix/prefix (not possible at all).

The next goal is to make future improvements easier, for example
supporting filename transitions in conditional policies or inherent
support for type attributes.

As for performance, the goal is to implement previous goals while not
killing the performance by them. Christian suggested some possible
optimizations [1], but after trying them out [2] they either not provide
much measurable difference or the difference is small and the
implementation hacky.
