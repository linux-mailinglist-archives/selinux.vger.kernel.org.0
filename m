The problem with the in-statement is that you might want to work
differently depending on the circumstances.

Imagine that you have the following:

(block b1
  (macro m (...)
    ...
  )
 ...
)

(in b1.m
  (allow ...)
)

(block b2
 (blockinherit b1)
 ...
)

How should the in-statement for b1.m behave?
You might want the in-statement to be resolved before any inheritance,
so that the inherited instance was also changed (imagine block b1
being inherited many times), but it is also possible that you only
want the change to happen for block b1. For better or worse, the
decision was made to have the in-statement be resolved before
inheritance is processed.

We can't change that behavior now, but I do see that there is a need
to support changing only specific instances.

I am thinking about creating a new rule that would act like an
in-statement, but be processed after inheritance. Not sure about the
name though: "append", "add", "addto", "with", "within"?
