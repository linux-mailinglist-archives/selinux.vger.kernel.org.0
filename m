Perhaps, but see below.

I think you might have misunderstood what lead to this, just a bit.

Previously the __kern_write() function was used for this communication
and Christoph's patch changed that to use kern_write() instead.

In theory that's a good idea because kern_write() adds some additional
sanity checks, one being a call to rw_verify_area() which is where the
security_file_permission() call fails.

So previously any random process could avoid these checks by calling
__kern_write() so the change to kern_write() is, in theory, that's a
good thing and simply reverting that hunk in Christoph's patch
probably isn't the best thing to do.

But any random process does need to be able to write to the automount
daemon pipe for trailing path components and the root dentry of autofs
mounts, depending on case.

So it's true that any write to any autofs dentry probably doesn't
need to be allowed but I question what that gets us in terms of
security improvement over allowing pipe writes for automount_t
labelled pipes in selinux policy since they must be within an autofs
mounted file system.

But Stephen has a different recommendation (and that appears to
consider the cause I outlined above) so I'll wait to see what others
think about the recommendations.
