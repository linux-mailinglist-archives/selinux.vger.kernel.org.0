I look at it this way: peers *are* processes, You seem to
essentually use peers as nodes above.

It would become more clear if you would try this out with labeled ipsec.
A peer, in my experience is kind of the same as an association in the
labeled ipsec scenario (the classes actually overlap). That is also why
you should probably disable the netlabel_peer_controls polcap if you use
labeled ipsec.
