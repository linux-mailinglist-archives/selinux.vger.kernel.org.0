systemd is increasing usage of memfds, pidfds, etc.  This is resulting 
in a need for wide inheritance of fds across the system.  For example in 
a lot of systemd interfaces that have a pid field now have a comparable 
pidfd interface.  dbus-broker and polkit are similarly updated.

Some references from an All Systems Go! talk: 
https://cfp.all-systems-go.io/media/all-systems-go-2023/submissions/T3LJAM/resources/ASG_2023_PID_FD-ize_all_the_things_E98Zw9Q.pdf 
  This is from a few months ago; the switch to PIDFDs is nearly 
complete, and we're already seeing denials for this usage.


Since file descriptors are increasing use as references for various 
operations, I think it would be useful to have a finer-grained fd class, 
so we can limit file descriptor inheritance, particularly as it looks 
like systemd/pid1 will need to inherit pidfd file descriptors from 
possibly all domains.  Specifically, I propose adding new permissions to 
the fd class, such as use_pidfd and use_memfd.  Then systemd can use 
pidfds from any domain, but only use regular fds from trusted domains.

Thoughts?
