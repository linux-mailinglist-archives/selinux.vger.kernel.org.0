There is also NETLINK_AUDIT which currently has message types defined
up to 2000.  The netlink message header format allows for 16 bit
message types (look at the nlmsghdr struct) and I think it would be a
mistake if the SELinux netlink/xperms code didn't support a full 16
bits for the message type.

As far as NETLINK_GENERIC is concerned, yes, that's a bit of a
nuisance both with the dynamic family IDs and buried message types.
On the plus side, there are existing kernel functions that will
resolve the generic netlink family IDs to a genl_family struct but
those are currently private to the generic netlink code; I imagine if
there was a need those functions (or something similar) could be made
available outside of the genetlink.c.  Once you've matched on
NETLINK_GENERIC and done the family resolution, it should just be a
matter of doing the generic netlink command lookup in the context of
the family, which really shouldn't be much different than looking up
the message type of a conventional netlink message.
