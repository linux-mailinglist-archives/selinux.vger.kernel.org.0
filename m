Sadly, yes :) Consider this scenario (assuming we fix the locking at
sidtab level):

If it happens that a new SID (x) is added via the new sidtab and then
another one (y) via the old sidtab, to avoid clash of SIDs, we would
need to leave a "hole" in the old sidtab for SID x. And this will
cause trouble if the thread that has just added SID y, then tries to
translate the context string corresponding to SID x (without re-taking
the RCU read lock and refreshing the policy pointer). Even if we
handle skipping the "holes" in the old sidtab safely, the translation
would then end up adding a duplicate SID entry for the context already
represented by SID x - which is not a state we want to end up in.

This is why I said that to fully fix this, we'd need to have a
both-ways live conversion in place. (And that already starts to feel
like too much hacking for something that should probably go to
stable@...)
