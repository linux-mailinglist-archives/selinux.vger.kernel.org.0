I know that some network filesystems and netlink use kernel sockets
for their in-kernel endpoints.  Looking quickly at the code I see
several other potential candidates include the Plan 9 filesystem and
RDS.

I'm not opposed to removing the concept of a kernel socket, or
improving the consistency of how we enforce policy with respect to
kernel sockets, but I'm going to need to see a lot more justification
and testing than booting a system and running the test suite.
