No because you need to populate the xattrs before the filesystem is
mounted and files are accessed. SELinux needs that information
*before* anything is allowed to happen.
The genfscon statement provides that initial label since the
filesystem is absent. So labelling for prebuilt images is usually done
during build time or paying the cost of a
restorecon at boot. In this case, everyboot since it doesn't persist.
