Nice, that is one way to confirm at least that systemd socket activation does the
right thing:

root@brutus:~# ss -antlZ | grep 6600
LISTEN 0      5                  *:6600            *:*    users:(("systemd",pid=968,proc_ctx=wheel.id:wheel.role:user.systemd.subj:s0,fd=28))       
root@brutus:~# ls -ZL /proc/968/fd/28
wheel.id:wheel.role:user.mpd.subj:s0 /proc/968/fd/28
root@brutus:~#
