Ok, I'm going to merge this patch with some minor edits (see [1]) if
you're okay with them and then I'll look into further improvements.

I don't think it makes sense to change it at this point, since the
user can always simply choose to ignore the socket peercon when using
the SOCK_SEQPACKET SCTP socket. My point really was that we obviously
can't test everything and if we have to choose between testing a less
meaningful interface and testing a more meaningful interface, we
should choose the latter. But it seems that in this case it won't be
too hard/costly to test both, so that point is no longer relevant.

I disagree, but it doesn't matter as we can't remove it at this point anyway.

No, we can't force that, but we could have refused to provide a
socket-level peer context on (potentially) 1-to-many sockets. I'm also
saying that we (the kernel) made it hard to enforce via policy that
the peer label returned corresponds to the actual peer. On the type
level it's easy as you can just not define any
SCTP_SOCKET__ASSOCIATION rules, but on MLS level you would have to
(AFAICT) add some non-trivial constraints to prevent peers with
non-matching levels to connect to the same socket (and thus basically
pretend to have different level if the userspace relies on the
socket's peer context).

That's irrelevant as the association doesn't correspond 1-to-1 to the
socket. If we really really wanted to provide a way to get the
association's peer context without peeling it off, we should do it via
some SCTP-specific getsockopt that would take assoc ID as an argument
(same as SCTP provides access to assoc-level info/properties). But
IMHO it wouldn't be worth the effort as peeling off the assoc or using
IP_PASSSEC should be a viable alternative in most if not all cases. I
still stand behind my opinion that providing no
socket-or-association-level peercon interface for SOCK_SEQPACKET would
have been better than providing a bad one. (But anyway, this
discussion is merely academic as it can't be undone now due to
backwards compatibility.)
