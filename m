There seem to be a few very different ways of using SELinux in
containers/guests, and many ways of using shared filesystems.

A common request is that we share a host filesystem into the guest (a
VM), and then the guest can do with it whatever it likes, preferably
without making the guest privileged in any way, and with having as few
priviliges on the daemons running on behalf of the guest ('virtiofd'
which is a fuse implementation daemon that runs on the host).

By remapping all guests xattr to add a "user.virtiofsd." prefix,
the guest can label it's filesystem and implement it's own SELinux
policy, but because it's using "user." on the host, it can neither
bypass nor change the hosts SELinux labelling or policies.

(It also means that the guest can set capabilities and other xattr's,
again without confusing the host).

Note that the remapping is done by the userspace daemon running on the
host (and takes parameters saying what remapping is required); as
such it's still bound by whatever LSM policies the host wants; we're
just giving the guest the ability to add it's own policies without
breaking the hosts.

Of course if you want the guest kernel to see the host xattrs
then you don't want the remapping; there are even some cases where you
might want to allow the guest to set those xattrs; but then you really
do have to start worrying about what the guest could do to your
filesystem.

The only thing getting in the way of the guest being able to do a full
relabel seems to be the limitation on user.* on non-files.
