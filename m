Oh, I think I was being unclear - I thought the first option, using
lsm_set_self_attr(), would allow choosing a subset of LSMs to setns to.
In contrast, the pure setns with a single flag is less flexible, but
possibly safer.  So I typed there the result of my train of thought,
which is that your second suggestion is probably preferable.
