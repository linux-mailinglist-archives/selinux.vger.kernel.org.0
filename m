I like that better.  In fact, we used to have that prior to:

commit 89abd0acf0335f3f760a3c0698d43bb1eaa83e44

     SELinux: drop load_mutex in security_load_policy

     We used to protect against races of policy load in security_load_policy
     by using the load_mutex.  Since then we have added a new mutex,
     sel_mutex, in sel_write_load() which is always held across all calls to
     security_load_policy we are covered and can safely just drop this one.
