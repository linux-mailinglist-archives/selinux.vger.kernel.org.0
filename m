No, it should work alongside genfscon. cgroupfs already was special
before that as it allowed relabeling despite genfscon being used.

It does make sense with named transitions, plus it was needed to make
even a simple parent-child inheritance work. Also, I believe some
cgroupfs files/directories (I think only directories?) can be created
by userspace, too.
