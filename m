Policy will be the second step. Our initial aim is to package the stock
refpolicy, and then I hope to tailor or write policy for common OpenWrt
services. We will expand from there. We are working with the monolithic
policy right now, but I would like to transition to modular policies
once things settle down.

My intuition is that OpenWrt will resemble standard Linux installs more
than Android. We'll see!
