Aiming for a simple solution first is generally a good first approach;

I'm not that worried about the allocation, in security_load_policy()
we're already allocating both a new policy and a new sidtab with
GFP_KERNEL so we are already looking at delays when under memory
pressure (which is okay in this case).  I view this as more desirable
than the approach taken in your first patch.

If we wanted to try and reduce our calls to kzalloc() we could always
allocate the new policy, sidtab, and convert_context_args structs in
one block via one kzalloc() call.  The drawback would be that we would
be allocating a bit more memory than we would need for normal usage
(the convert struct space would generally be wasted), and I guess
there might be an increased chance of the allocation taking the slow
path since the chunk would be larger.  Likely not worth pursuing
unless we see real memory problems in the future.
