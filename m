I took the call_rcu() approach in this patch because that is what KaiGai did and what was done in the AVC but it seems like synchronize_rcu() is preferred when possible.

I renoved my patches and are testing.

I desided to try out the callback befor sending. I think that will be good for the preformance of queued booleans.

I have also verified that all the allocation changes needed in earlier incarnation is seems not to be needed.
