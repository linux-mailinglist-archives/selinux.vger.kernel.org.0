It doesn't appear the superblock is shared between processes. Here is 
what I did to verify:

1. Modified test_bpf_map_create in testsuite so it forks/starts two 
concurrent processes that each trigger bpf map creation.

2. Added debug printf in selinux_bpffs_creator_sid (in 
'selinux/security/selinux/hooks.c') to print out current task pid/tgid, 
super_block pointer, and superblock_security_struct pointer.

3. Observed that the printed super_block and superblock_security_struct 
addresses were unique for each pid/tgid, indicating a distinct 
superblock instance per mount.

 From the code level, Paul also helped to review bpffs superblock 
creation. Here is his response:

You can confirm this by looking at the bpf_get_tree() function which is 
used to create a new bpffs tree.  The bpf_get_tree() function calls into 
get_tree_nodev(), which calls into vfs_get_super(), which calls into 
sget_fc() with a NULL "test" parameter.  When sget_fc() is called with a 
NULL "test" parameter a new superblock is created regardless of if any 
existing bpffs superblocks already exist.
