No, I don't like this approach at all. Before the sidtab refactor, it
had been done exactly this way - ENOMEM was returned while the sidtab
was "frozen" (i.e. while the existing entries were being converted).
And this was a real nuisance because things would fail randomly during
policy reload. And it's not just unimportant explicit userspace
actions that can fail. Any kind of transition can lead to a new SID
being created and you'd get things like execve(), mkdir(), ... return
-ENOMEM sometimes. (With a low probability, but still...)

I wouldn't compare it to a memory allocation failure, which normally
starts happening only when the system becomes overloaded. Here the
user would *awlays* have some probability of getting this error, and
they couldn't do anything about it.

Perhaps it wasn't clear from what I wrote, but I certainly don't want
to abandon it completely. Just to revert to a safe state until we
figure out how to do the RCU policy reload safely. The solution with
two-way conversion seems doable, it's just not a quick and easy fix.
