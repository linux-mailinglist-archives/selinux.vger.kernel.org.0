Sounds like that won't be an issue then. Good. I don't think in terms of
"them". I would probably use the same key/crt for both the hosts root as
well as extension images. I also think that I would probably update my
extensions if a change to the hosts policy affects them negatively. I am
not sure if systemd.v (vpick) currently works with extensions and or if
there are plans to make that work but I can see the potential benefits
in that regard

systemd-mountfsd allows unprivileged users to request it to mount images
on their behalf. I don't know how per-user extensions for say ~/.config
and/or ~/.local(/share)? would be implemented technically but I have no
doubt that if there is a desire/interest for such functionality that Poettering
will be able to implement it.

I imagine that it could work similar with for example starting a
systemd --user service unit with RootImage= or systemd-nspawn -I ran without
root. Which by the way present similar challenges.

But. Keep in mind that we have container, root, extension and portable
image types. They all have similar challenges and aside from root images
they can be imported with importctl. importctl --user currently works
for container images and so I have no reason to believe that it will not
be made to work if there is a desire for per-user extensions and/or portables.

Again. Not opposed per se. Just contributing my 2 cents. Happy to share
my thoughts.
