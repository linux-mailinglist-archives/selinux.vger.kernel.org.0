As I mentioned in the RCU patch thread, my preference at this point in
time is to address this with comments and not pass the mutex into the
security server.

FWIW, my preference is for aligned argument lists, for example:

  void write_program(char *language,
                     char *description);

... with the understanding that tabs are used as much as possible and
that spaces are only used to make up the difference when the gap is
less than a tab (8 chars).

However, I don't feel quite as strongly about this as other things,
e.g. 80 char line widths, so as long as the code passes checkpatch.pl
I'll merge it regardless of the argument alignment.
