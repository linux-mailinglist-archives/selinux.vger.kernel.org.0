I knew that I was creating some redundancy in the rules, but I was
trying to eliminate the special cases. Now that I have something that
appears to be working, it will probably be worth it to go back and see
how messy it would be to remove some of the redundancy.

I am going to be on vacation for the last two weeks of December, so I
won't be getting back to this until January anyway.

Thanks for the quick look and comments!
