You are correct, the observed behavior is not consistent with the
documentation. I might have an idea on how to make it work as
documented, but, otherwise, the documentation should be changed to
reflect what actually happens.

I will admit that it is somewhat arbitrary. I think that what was in
mind was policy like:
(block service1
  (type t)
  (macro run ((type x))
    (allow t x (CLASS1 (PERM1)))
  )
)
(block service2
  (type t)
  (allow t self (CLASS2 (PERM2)))
  (call service1.run(t))
)
With the resulting policy being:
(allow service2.t self (CLASS2 (PERM2)))
(allow service1.t service2.t (CLASS1 (PERM1)))

That is as intended. I could make arguments for doing it different,
but that is how it is.
You can make sure the allow rule in the macro refers to the global a
by using (allow .a .a (file (read))).

That is weird. I would have expected the global a. I will have to take
a look at this.
