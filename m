Indeed, I am so used to subprocess.check_output() and
subprocess.Popen(), that can both take arguments as a list, that I
expected it to be the same with subprocess.getstatusoutput(), but it
is not correct. Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for fixing it!

Anyway, using getstatusoutput() by concatenating a path to a command
line makes get_xml_file() broken when operating on paths with spaces,
as the paths are not quoted nor escaped before they are concatenated.
In my humble opinion, I would prefer if the code was written in a more
"defensive" way. But because nobody seems to have complained about
this so far and because Python's standard library does not help much,
I accept keeping getstatusoutput() for now.

I agree, but this would be quite complex (the implementations of this
idea that I imagine would consists in editing the Python source code
with "sed" commands when installing the file). But it would
nonetheless be nice if
"/usr/share/selinux/devel/include/support/segenxml.py" could also be
configured in Makefile...
Anyway, for "python3 vs. /usr/bin/python3", I would like to stick as
closely as possible with the meaning: use "/usr/bin/..." for
system-wide programs/files and use "/usr/bin/env" or "python" for
programs that can be run in Python's virtual environments. As
/usr/share/selinux/devel/include/support/segenxml.py falls into
category "system-wide files", my choice would be for /usr/bin/python3.

Thanks,
Nicolas
