All this conversation is great, and I look forward to a better solution, 
but if we go back to the patch, it was to fix an issue where the kernel 
is requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for writing user Xattrs on link files and 
other special files.

The documented reason for this is to prevent the users from using XATTRS 
to avoid quota.

The CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability is denfined to allow processes with this 
capability to ignore quota.

This PR allows processes with CAP_SYS_RESOURCE to create user Xattrs.

To me this makes sense.

Is there any argument against this?
