Thanks for your explanation. This indeed clarified the understanding I
have of these patches and I agree with merging the 2 patches you used
as a base of your 2 patches. I have created a Pull Request for this,
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/pull/172 , and will merge it
tomorrow if nobody disagrees.

Thanks,
Nicolas
