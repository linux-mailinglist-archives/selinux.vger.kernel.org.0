The early labeled NFS work included a notion of a label
domain-of-interpretation (DOI) field and label translation as part of
the infrastructure but I don't think that made it into mainline?
It is however part of the NFSv4.2 spec I believe (called a label
format specifier or LFS).
At present I believe the assumption is that either the NFS server is
just a "dumb" server that is not enforcing any SELinux policy at all
(just storing the labels for use by clients) or is enforcing the same
policy as the clients.

A while ago James Morris proposed an approach to namespaced selinux
xattrs to support selinux namespaces,
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/alpine.LFD.2.20.1711212009330.6297@localhost/
.
However, that keeps them in the security.* namespace which on the one
hand better protects them from tampering but runs afoul of virtiofsd's
goal of avoiding the need to run with capabilities.

If we use the user. namespace we need a way to control which processes
can change these attributes (or remove them) on the host; optimally we
could limit it to only virtiofsd itself and no other processes not
even
root processes on the host. That presumably requires some kind of LSM
hook or hook call; the current SELinux setxattr and removexattr hooks
don't care about user.* beyond a general setattr permission check.
