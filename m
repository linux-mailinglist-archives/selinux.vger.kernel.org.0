I'm finding it difficult to follow as well, so my questions are just an 
attempt to understand the latest model.

> In the case of EADD (non-NULL vma), are we passing both vma and sigstruct file? If so, which file dictates allowed permissions, vma->vm_file or sigstruct, or both???

My impression was that they were going to pass both, but the sigstruct 
file is the target of permission checks.  The vma if non-NULL would be 
used to determine whether PROT_EXEC is being added or was already 
present and whether EXECMOD needs to be checked (i.e. copy-on-write has 
occurred and PROT_EXEC is being added).

> In the case of EAUG (NULL vma), all other parameters are constant for any given enclave. Then why do we call this same hook for every region added, assuming the hook will return the same value everytime anyway?

Yes, I was wondering about that as well.

> And it looks like ACTIVATE_REGION is needed only because the proposed security_enclave_load() would base its decision on the sigstruct file. An alternative is to base that decision on /dev/sgx/enclave. Of course the former has finer granularity but is that really necessary? From security perspective, only the weakest link matters. FILE__EXECMOD on a regular shared object could allow exploits of all bugs throughout the host process because code within that shared object is modifiable by not only itself but also any code within that same process. In contrast, FILE__EXECMOD on /dev/sgx/enclave only allows enclaves to modify themselves. They cannot modify each other, neither can "untrusted" code outside of enclaves modify any of them. So it doesn't look like a weaker link to me. Moreover, requiring FILE__EXECMOD on sigstruct means it could be used as a target buffer for code injection attacks. IMHO that *lowers* the security of the whole process.

This is partly why I suggested separate ENCLAVE__EXECMOD and other 
checks below, so we can distinguish between FILE__EXECMOD versus 
ENCLAVE__EXECMOD on the sigstruct file.  If using /dev/sgx/enclave as 
the target, then we don't need a separate permission per se but we lose 
the per-sigstruct granularity.

I'm not a fan of passing __user pointers to LSM hooks.  And it certainly 
shouldn't be looking at the buffer since it could change between the 
time of check and time of use.

ENCLAVE__LOAD and/or ENCLAVE__INIT would be to support whitelisting of 
what enclaves can be loaded/initialized by the process.  That's separate 
from the W^X discussion.  Those permissions would be between the process 
and either the sigstruct file or the enclave file (the consensus seemed 
to be the sigstruct file as the stronger/more complete binding of the 
enclave).  We probably only need one of those two permission checks not 
both.

ENCLAVE__EXECUTE, ENCLAVE__EXECMEM, ENCLAVE__EXECMOD would allow 
distinctions between host process mmap/mprotect PROT_EXEC operations 
(which would continue to apply FILE__EXECUTE, PROCESS__EXECMEM, and 
FILE__EXECMOD checks if appropriate) and the driver's setting of initial 
and runtime permissions (which would apply ENCLAVE__EXECUTE, 
ENCLAVE__EXECMEM, and ENCLAVE__EXECMOD checks if appropriate). That's 
particularly helpful if we are using the sigstruct or enclave file as 
the target of all checks instead of /dev/sgx/enclave, so that we don't 
have to allow FILE__EXECUTE or FILE__EXECMOD to the sigstruct file by 
the host process.
