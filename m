MPTCP sockets are created via the conventional sys_socket() call path
or sk_clone_lock(). MPTCP subflows are created via sock_create_kern()
or csk_af_ops->syn_recv_sock().

Overall the above matches what plain TCP does: client sockets and
listener sockets will hit selinux_socket_post_create(), server sockets
will hit security_sk_clone().

MPTCP subflows call both the above, via the relevant TCP call-path.
MPTCP sockets calls security_inet_conn_request() for client sockets on
connect(), but it looks like we currently lack a call
to security_inet_csk_clone() for server MPTCP sockets, as they are
created via direct call to sk_clone_lock().

I think that could be easily handled with an MPTCP patch.

yes, it helped, thanks!

My understanding is that the MPTCP implementation aligns with this
proposed patch - modulo the required changed mentioned above, which
looks like a MPTCP bug.

Cheers,
