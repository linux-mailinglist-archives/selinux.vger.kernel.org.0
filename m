That's the purpose of this thread, I believe. Now, whether we'll ever
get to true consensus seems unlikely, but I expect to see something
close enough that the wailing of those opposed will fail to prevent
acceptance.

I don't see that at all. For whatever reason, the developers of
namespaces chose to ignore the LSM infrastructure and the implications
their scheme has upon it. Managing the combination of differing
philosophies is often complex, and this is no exception.

Again, call_void_hook()

That was an argument made against the lsm_set_self_attr() interface
in the beginning. Even if lsm_set_self_attr() isn't the answer, it
provides a clue on how to formulate one.

That's what flags are for. Or did I miss something?

All the more reason not to implement them at the LSM level. If
you can't meet expectations, the effort is futile.

A 'container' is whatever the snake oil sales rep says it is.
Kata containers use virtual machines. Containers may be implemented
without an "orchestration system".

The base system policy will still be enforced. Having multiple policies
in place is tricky. What we can't have is a system where the base
policy is replaced rather than supplemented. It that not obvious?
