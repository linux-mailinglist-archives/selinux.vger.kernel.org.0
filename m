If "initial permissions" for enclaves are less restrictive than shared objects, then it'd become a backdoor for circumventing LSM when enclave whitelisting is *not* in place. For example, an adversary may load a page, which would otherwise never be executable, as an executable page in EPC.

In the case a RWX page is needed, the calling process has to have a RWX page serving as the source for EADD so PROCESS__EXECMEM will have been checked. For SGX2, changing an EPC page to RWX is subject to FILE__EXECMEM on /dev/sgx/enclave, which I see as a security benefit because it only affects the enclave but not the whole process hosting it.

I'm not sure I understand the motivation behind this proposal to decouple initial EPC permissions from source pages.

I don't think it a big deal to fully mmap() enclave files, which have to be parsed by user mode anyway to determine various things including but not limited to the size of heap(s), size and number of TCSs/stacks/TLS areas, and the overall enclave size. So with PHDRs parsed, it's trivial to mmap() each segment with permissions from its PHDR.

I'm lost. Why is EAUG tied to permissions on .sigstruct?
