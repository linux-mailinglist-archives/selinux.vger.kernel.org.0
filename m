Two things:

1. It means we have to send a pseudo-signal to the parent, to get the
parent to bail out into signal handling context, which can lead to
extra spurious -EGAIN in the parent. I think this is probably fine
since _most_ parent processes will already expect to handle SIGCHLD
signals...

2. If the parent is blocked on some other killable wait, we won't be
able to make progress - so in particular, if the parent was using a
killable wait to wait for the child to leave its syscall, userspace
=E1=BA=81ould deadlock (in a way that could be resolved by SIGKILLing one o=
f
the processes). Actually, I think that might happen if the parent uses
ptrace() with sufficiently bad timing? We could avoid the issue by
doing an interruptible wait instead of a killable one, but then that
might confuse userspace callers of the keyctl() if they get an
-EINTR...
I guess the way to do this cleanly is to use an interruptible wait and
return -ERESTARTNOINTR if it gets interrupted?

There are basically two parts to this, it could be split up nicely into the=
se:

1. refactor code in security/keys/
2. rip out all the code that is now unused (as you can see in the
diffstat, basically everything outside security/keys/ is purely
removals)

I wouldn't want to split it up further: As long as the cred_transfer
mechanism and LSM hook still exist, all the LSMs that currently have
implementations of it should also still implement it.

But I think if patch 2/2 is just ripping out unused infrastructure
across the tree, that should be sufficiently reviewable? (Or we could
split it up into ripping out one individual helper per patch, but IDK,
that doesn't seem to me like it adds much reviewability.)
