Oops, that was a mistake in the fixing up of the cover letter.  When I 
rebased
on your patches I fixed that issue in code and in the commit message for 
the second
patch in the series, but it looks like I missed it here and in the other 
commit messages.
I'll clean that up and resend with the additional ccs.  Thanks!
