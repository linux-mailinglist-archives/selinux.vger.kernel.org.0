Heh, yeah, it's not duplicating LSM functionality.  What I was trying to
say is that this patch allows LSMs to implement policies that are
equivalent to their existing functionality, e.g. paves the way to add
security_enclave_load() as an equivalent to security_file_mprotect().

I'll add that.

Brain fart.  Flags can just take PROT_{READ,WRITE,EXEC}.

I can add a dummy helper to translate flags and encapsulate the below
assert.

The original thought was to define them for userspace, but that's broken
because VM_* aren't defined for userspace.

To assert that the hardware defined SECINFO flags are interchangeable with
Linux's software defined flags, i.e. don't need to be translated.
