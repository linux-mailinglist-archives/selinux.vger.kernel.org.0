At present, we are already applying the general socket layer access
controls to AF_SMC sockets; hence, existing policies can prevent or
allow use of AF_SMC sockets through that mechanism. This is useful for
reducing kernel attack surface, e.g. prevent all use of AF_SMC by
untrusted code, or to limit use of AF_SMC to specific
processes/programs.

Since kernel commit d25a92ccae6bed02327b63d138e12e7806830f78
("net/smc: Introduce IPPROTO_SMC"), there is a way to bypass such
controls by creating such sockets via (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,
IPPROTO_SMC) instead of AF_SMC. In that situation, any process that is
allowed the socket layer permissions to the generic socket class would
be allowed to create/use SMC sockets.

Jeongjun's patch closes this bypass and ensures consistent application
of the general socket layer access controls for SMC sockets. Given
that, I don't see why we would defer merging it until someone figures
out a more complete solution for SMC sockets. It's more of a bug fix
than an enhancement.
