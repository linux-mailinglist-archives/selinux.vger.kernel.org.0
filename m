I do not understand what you mean by that. Context
"system_u:object_r:root_t" is a "file" context and I do not understand
where you get that from.

Busybox is a shell with built-in modules AFAIK. It should be labeled
"u:object_r:shell_exec_t" IMHO

https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/releases/download/20200710/selinux-python-3.1.tar.gz

Its hard to say. There are quite a few variables and I am not sure
exactly what the current state of your work is and where you want to go
(ie what your goals and requirements are)

I guess you should determine what the login programs used are and then
to address those to ensure that login user shells are labeled the way
you want them labeled.

It is probably best to enclose avc denials for any challenge you face.
