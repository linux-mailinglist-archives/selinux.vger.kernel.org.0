I'm working under the assumption that if the user has enabled SELinux
the common case is to have a SELinux policy loaded.  Outside of some
automated testing bots, we haven't really seen a lot of reports from
people running with SELinux enabled but no policy loaded ... after
all, what would be the point of that configuration?

Anyway, leaving the selinux_initialized() check in
__inode_security_revalidate(), as opposed to the callers, means we
don't hit that check in the common case where the inode's SELinux
state is still valid/initialized.  If the inode's state is set to
LABEL_INITIALIZED we know that we have a policy loaded and
selinux_initialized() is going to be true.

Thanks, also fixed.  At one point in my private working branch I had a
patch that incorporated the cache into the code paths that end up in
inode_has_perm() and I suspect that in the process of cutting that out
I mixed it up with the revalidate changes.  It's also very possible I
just missed it :)

Related to my comments above, doing a single isec->initialized check
should be quicker as we avoid the selinux_initialized() and
might_sleep_if() checks.  Yes, both *should* be fairly minor, but
things add up fairly quickly in the allmodconfig test.

I thought about that, but was worried about that being a source of a
potential future bug if someone introduced code that returned early in
a success case (the uninitialized case likely doesn't count).  I'm
also not overly worried about this from a performance perspective, in
the worst case where we are transferring the cache we do one
additional u32 assignment during exec; that doesn't seem too terrible
to me.

Unless I'm mistaken, the
security_transfer_creds()/selinux_cred_transfer() hook only gets
called in a bizarre key API (which needs work, but that's a very
different discussion) and not part of a normal exec.

Not necessary, task_avdcache_search() checks to ensure that the task's
current SID matches the SID used when populating the cache, if there
is a mismatch the cache is reset.  Given how rare this case should be
in practice, and the fact that we would want a check in
task_avdcache_search() anyway, I'd just assume let the search routine
catch the change and handle it.

I know I argued against adding some simple checks earlier in this
email, but considering the impact of returning "bad" data from the
cache, I'd feel a whole lot better checking the SIDs before searching
through the cache.

Yes, we want to improve performance, but I don't want to do it at the
cost of making the code more fragile.  Maybe we can revisit the idea
of removing the SID from the cache at a later date, but right now I'd
feel a lot more comfortable leaving it as-is; this patch already
provides a nice drop in SELinux cost, let's be happy with that for
now.

(Somewhat related to the incremental change above, I suspect we'll get
a bigger bump by working to make avc_policy_seqno() faster through
inlining.  At the very least, we're always going to need to check the
AVC regardless of the SID check.  I spent a few minutes looking at it,
but decided the patch was already creeping well beyond just
selinux_inode_permission() improvements so I left it alone.  That's
worth another look later.)
