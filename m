Will update to fetch the latest measurement entry for selinux state.

I have posted a patch that adds test in LTP to validate selinux 
measurement made by IMA. That test extracts the latest selinux 
measurement entry from the IMA log and validates. The link to that patch 
is https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11804587/

Agreed. The measurement of selinux state done by IMA would ideally be 
validated by a remote attestation service against expected state.

The test patch, for adding a test for validating selinux measurement, 
extracts the latest entry for selinux policy measurement and validates
against the policy read from /sys/kernel/selinux/policy.

This is just to validate that the selinux policy was measured correctly 
by selinux & IMA.

Similar to selinux state verification, a remote attestation service 
should validate the policy hash against an expected hash to validate 
that the policy set by the administrator hasn't been tampered with.

Agreed - will change it to scnprintf().

I will allocate event name and if that succeeds then read the state.
