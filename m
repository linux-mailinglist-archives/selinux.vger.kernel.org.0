I don't think you understand the purpose of this code.  It isn't
implementing SGX, nor is it needed by SGX.
It is providing shared infrastructure for security modules, similar to
lsm_audit.c, so that security modules can enforce W^X or similar
memory protection guarantees for SGX enclave memory, which has unique
properties that render the existing mmap and mprotect hooks
insufficient. They can certainly implement it only for SELinux, but
then any other security module that wants to provide such guarantees
will have to replicate that code.

 BTW, it is alloced/freed automatically by LSM infrastructure in security_e=

? I'm not sure the definition of "security data" here. It does store some "=
data", something that multiple LSM modules would need to duplicate if not p=
