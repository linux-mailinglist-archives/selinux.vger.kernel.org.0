I don't even know what use case it's supposed to solve :) I suppose if
you freshly format some storage drive and you want the root dir to be
labeled immediately after mounting, rootcontext= could be useful. For
such a use case Stephen's approach would make sense (you might still
want to eventually relabel the root dir to something else), but there
are some gotchas... For example, the label is initially set only in
the inode security struct, but not written to the xattrs (I only
looked at the code briefly, I could be wrong here), so you would still
need to manually set the label on the root directory after mounting
for the label to persist. And if you remount the superblock after
changing the label, the internal label will be reset to the old one
(which you are forced to specify in the mount options), but again not
persistently. That's all very unintuitive.

So, IMHO, good ways to fix it are either disallowing changing the
label altogether, or making sure the label is propagated to the xattrs
(if supported) and allowing to remount with a different rootcontext=
option (or with no rootcontext). But that's only if I guessed the use
case correctly.
