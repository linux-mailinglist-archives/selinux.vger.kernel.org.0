I think Casey is talking about now (when AppArmor is not supported by
this feature) and you're talking about the future (when AppArmor may be
supported by this feature).

Now, a "measure func=LSM_STATE" rule would be accepted by the IMA policy
parser but do nothing for the AppArmor LSM. The rule may do something in
the future but there's no difference in feedback to the IMA policy
author between now and the future.
