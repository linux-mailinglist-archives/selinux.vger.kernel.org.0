Ok, this rings a bell...  I think we talked about this on an earlier
revision...

Ok, so in that case, I think I'd test audit_context() and if it is
indeed NULL then create a local context, otherwise use the one that is
available.  I should really go back and look carefully again at your
code to see if it is in fact doing this, but unilaterally creating a
local context if a context already exists is going to cause confusion
because there will be two events generated for one event.

Is it possible these functions are not actually generating records if
the context is NULL?

I'd be digging to find out why the context is NULL in these cases and if
any record is even being produced in those cases?  Perhaps there is an
active filter that indicates that logging is not of interest for that
process/task/file/syscall/perm/etc...

What has been done is to call it with a NULL context and it would assign
a timestamp and serial number, but those are all single records that
don't need synchronization (obviously).  This was why I'd come up with
this mechanism to solve the need to attach a contid record to a single
record associated with a network event (or user record that should not
be associated with a syscall).  Those were the only two use cases I had
up until now.
