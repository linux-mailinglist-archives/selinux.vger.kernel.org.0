Thank you so much for working on this, I really appreciate the help!

As far as potential merge issues with netdev/net-next and lsm/next, I
think we'll be okay.  I have a general policy[1] of not accepting new
patchsets, unless critical bugfixes, past rc5/rc6 so this would be
merged into lsm/next *after* the current merge window closes and
presumably after the netdev/net-next branch finds its way into Linus'
tree.
