Yeah, excluding policydb_destroy() from the move is what's needed to
get a nice patch... Actually, what do you think about keeping the
bugfix patch as before (with the forward declaration) and then doing
the moving around in a separate patch (removing the forward
declaration)? Then we keep the patch with the actual fix small, but
still get a clean final result. It would also allow moving
policydb_destroy() up closer to the other destroy functions in another
separate patch (I tried it and both patches end up clean when the move
is split up like this). (I don't have a strong preference for this,
let me know what works best for you.)
