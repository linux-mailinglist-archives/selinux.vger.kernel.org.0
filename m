Absolutely.  So far, CIL has worked great for what I need.  I'll 
definitely contribute or reach out if I run into issues though.  I 
hope/expect that the overall development will exercise some CIL corner 
cases that may not have gotten a lot of use in the past, although that 
remains to be seen.

I definitely have less CIL expertise than you, so please correct me if I 
have anything inaccurate about CIL.  I don't think there are any 
fundamental differences/incompatibilities between CIL inheritance and 
Cascade inheritance, at least not in the big picture.  They're both 
generally aiming at solving a similar problem in a similar manner.  They 
both inherit rules and create name mangled derived types for children. 
In contrast to CIL, Cascade intermingles attributes and inheritance.  So 
if I inherit from a parent, I automatically have an attribute for all 
children that I can reference elsewhere.  Cascade inheritance is also 
used to check function arguments.  So I can have a function that only 
takes children of the foo type and will throw a compiler error if used 
otherwise.  I don't *think* CIL has something similar to that?

I think one of the bigger distinctions (across the board, but including 
inheritance) is that syntactic sugar is an explicit non-goal of CIL, and 
an explicit goal of Cascade. Our objective is to make inheritance easier 
to use and natural feeling for developers who are familiar with object 
oriented programming languages.  I'll leave it up to others to decide 
whether we've succeeded there, and/or whether we can succeed there as we 
continue to develop.

This was mostly just around the centrality of the inheritance feature to 
Cascade.  It seemed like we'd have more flexibility doing that one by 
hand so to speak.  Our overall goal was to avoid reimplementing things 
that CIL already does, and just compile into the underlying CIL feature. 
  It's entirely possible that we could have/could in the future make 
more use of CIL's inheritance functionality.  That would be a win in 
terms of interoperability.  Inheritance of non-virtual types is on my 
TODO list, and when I get to that, I'll do some more in depth digging on 
whether we can lean more into existing CIL functionality here, which 
might make that use case easier.  That said, doing name mangling in our 
code rather than leaving it to CIL allows us the ability to have more 
control over applying things like annotations.  Annotations aren't used 
yet to their full potential, but my hope is that they can ultimately be 
used to provide a set of "debug symbols" consumed by audit2cascade and 
other tooling, in order to improve automated response to detected AVC 
denials, and policy discoverability for non-experts trying to understand 
said denials.  I *think* that as we aim to continue down that path, 
having full control over the list of types in the policy from inside the 
Cascade compiler will be important.

Future work.  The library backend supports it, but I haven't updated the 
front end yet.

Future work.  Our primary internal use case that we hope to migrate for 
Cascade for involves compiling policies for multiple systems from the 
same repo, so we'll definitely need module support.  In particular the 
ability to mix and match groups of modules easily is important to us. 
What I'd like to do is add new `system {}` and `module {}` blocks that 
integrate naturally with everything else, and add options to casc to 
support easily building multiple systems.  On our existing refpolicy 
based setup, we have to do a lot of shell script processing to get 
everything to work well, and it's challenging to maintain.

In terms of optional blocks, Chris and I have argued about optional a 
few times, and part of the reason there's nothing about optional so far 
is because we'd like to solicit community feedback there.  My personal 
view is that explicitly marking statements as optional is tedious and 
error prone.  But I don't have a really slam dunk "clearly better" 
solution to propose yet at this point.  I have a few ideas, but they all 
need to be more thoroughly thought out and there are some holes and 
issues to address.  I viewed this feature as non-essential for an 
initial proof of concept, and am glad that we can have design 
discussions about it in the open.

So in short, yes, I think the ability to differentiate that certain 
rules are required for a module to work and others are optional is 
definitely needed.  But I'm not yet set on what the best way to do that 
is.  One key goal here is that a developer of a component should be able 
to add policy with fairly minimal knowledge of SELinux.  I'd prefer it 
if most of the time they could do the right thing without knowing about 
optional, but I'm not yet sure what the best/cleanest way to achieve 
that will be.

Yes, currently these things are all hard-coded in CIL.  My goal in 
general is to have sensible defaults for people who don't care, but 
allow override for people who do.  So where I'd like to get to in the 
long term is to continue to define these things in code, but allow 
policy developers or either modify the defaults, or completely override 
them with their own implementations.  That's future work.

Future work.  The overall goal would be for users who say "I don't need 
UBAC" or "I don't need RBAC", then they could just get something with 
automatic users and roles, like as in Android, with zero effort.  But we 
definitely want fully featured UBAC and RBAC support available for those 
who need it.
