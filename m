I would vote for just removing it rather than basically duplicating
the Lockdown LSM functionality. It likely wouldn't even be complete as
a couple of the security_locked_down() calls happen at __init time,
where SELinux wouldn't get a chance to deny them (no policy loaded
yet).

(Well... I *tried* to make this thing work, but it really feels like
too much hassle to reasonably tweak all the existing callers to
fulfill the SELinux expectations to be worth it. I admit I'll be kind
of relieved to see the lockdown class go - it brought me nothing but
pain :) It would be a nice feature if done right, but that would have
to be a new patch that somehow deals with all the intricacies...
Either someone finds enough motivation to do it, or it just shouldn't
be there, IMHO.)
