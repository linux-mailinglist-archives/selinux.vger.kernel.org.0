An explicit ioctl() after EACCEPTCOPY to update the allowed permissions.
For all intents and purposes, the EAUG'd page must start RW.  Maybe a
better way to phrase it is that at some point the page must be writable
to have any value whatsover.  EACCEPTCOPY explicitly requires the page to
be at least RW.  EACCEPT technically doesn't require RW, but a RO or RX
zero page is useless.  Userspace could still EACCEPT with RO or RX, but
SGX would assume a minimum of RW for the purposes of the LSM check.

Yep, same idea, except in the proposed flow ACTIVATE_REGION.

Heh, I intentionally said "x86 paging" to rule out EPT :-)  I'm pretty
sure it's a moot point though, I have a hard time believing an LSM will
allow RW->X and not RW->RX.

In theory, it's still your MAXPERM model, but with the unnecessary states
removed and the others enforced/handled by the natural SGX transitions
instead of explictly in ioctls.  Underneath the hood the SGX driver would
still need to track the MAXPERM.

With SGX1, SECINFO == MAXPERM.  With SGX2, ACTIVATE_REGION == MAXPERM,
with the implication that the previous state is always RW.

Yes, but the *EPCM* permissions are immutable.  So if an enclave wants
to do RW->RX it has to intialize its pages to RWX.  And because the
untrusted runtime is, ahem, untrusted, the enclave cannot rely on
userspace to never map its pages RWX.  In other words, from a enclave
security perspective, an SGX1 enclave+runtime that uses RW->RX is no
different than an enclave that uses RWX.  Using your earlier terminology,
an SGX1 enclave *should* get a dirty looks if maps a page RWX in the EPCM,
even if it only intends RW->RX behavior.
