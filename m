Considering the relative maturity of bpf, and bpffs, I think it's okay
to take this small step right now, with the understanding that more
work may need to be done, depending on how this is generally adopted
by distros and users (for those of you not following the other thread,
I've merged the v3 draft of this patch).

However, I've been noticing a trend from the Android folks of tossing
patches over the wall without much thought beyond the Android use
case.  I understand the Android devs have a job to do, and products to
focus on, but I would strongly encourage them to think a bit longer
about more general use cases before submitting patches upstream.
