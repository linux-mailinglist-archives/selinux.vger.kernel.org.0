I am not very familiar with -Bsymbolic and did not know about
-fno-semantic-interposition before a few days ago. As far as I
understand, -Bsymbolic puts an entry of type "SYMBOLIC" in the dynamic
section of the .so file, which changes the behavior of the dynamic
linker at link time without modifying anything in the build-time
linking process. It is only compatible with ELF files and seems quite
uncommon.
With this in mind, -fno-semantic-interposition seems more powerful and
better suited for what we want to achieve (to optimize the
compilation). I agree with the approach of this patchset and would
have given an Acked-By if there weren't an issue with "-z,relro-Wl" ;)

Thanks for working on this!
Nicolas
