That is effectively a "targeted" policy model. You target a selection of
entities and everything else is "unconfined" (ie not targeteed).

An "unconfined" domain is just a process type that has many allow rules
associated with it making it effectively similar to an "permissive"
domain. The difference is that since "unconfined" domains have full
access there should not be any AVC denials (nothing is blocked by
SELinux because the policy does not target the entity)

The stock policy enforced in Red Hat based distributions is a "targeted"
policy model for example. The unconfined_t domain is one of various
"unconfined" domains (other examples are unconfined_service_t but
effectively any type could be made unconfined by simply allowing all accesses.
