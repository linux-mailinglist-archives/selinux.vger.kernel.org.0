I think the challenge is going to be having enough information when
the socket is created to do any useful type transition.  I'm open to
suggestions, but I'm skeptical there is anything we can do beyond the
current approach.

The problem with waiting until the connect()/bind() is that you are
effectively doing a relabel operation, which is a big no-no (but you
already know that).  *Maybe* you could justify it in the special case
of stream sockets, as I'm pretty sure there is no way to do anything
useful with them as a data sink/source until they are either connected
to a remote peer or bound to a local port, however, we would all need
to think on that for a bit (it is still a relabel, and thus nasty) and
probably spend some time staring at the code to make sure there is no
way to do something sneaky with an unconnected or unbound stream
socket.
