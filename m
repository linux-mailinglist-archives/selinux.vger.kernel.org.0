Yes, something like that. Here are a few aspects to consider:

- We should be careful with clearing /tmp in general as it could
  interfere with the running system. (for example /tmp/.X11-unix/X0)

- The issue, i think, were trying to solve is not limited to /tmp. The
  up-side is that we can determine what is affected by just
  interpretting the <<none>> specs from the file_contexts were using to
  relabel the file system. Anything with a <<none>> spec is affected and
  not just /tmp/.*

- One alternative would be to, instead of giving the caller to option to
  clear /tmp, explain the issue and how to solve it manually.

- If we leave /tmp uncleared then that might affect the next boot. For
  example youre enforcing a new policy, youre relabeling the filesystem
  according to new specifications. the context currently associated
  with /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 is invalidated by the to be enforced policy. Now
  Xserver might no longer be allowed to operate on the sock file with
  invalid label, and break. (of course I suppose any currently
  running Xserver might "break" as well if you clear /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
  at run-time).

True.

Just stating that something is currently half-baked does not
necessarily mean I can do a better job.
