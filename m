I think for this kind of complete policy changeover, you need to
relabel prior to rebooting.  Obviously that carries its own set of
challenges; you'd at least have to switch to permissive mode first and
potentially run setfiles in a domain (e.g. setfiles_mac_t) that is
allowed to get/set contexts unknown to the current policy
(CAP_MAC_ADMIN + capability2 mac_admin permission) or load the new
policy prior to running setfiles.  Or boot with SELinux disabled,
label via setfiles, and then boot with the new policy.  The preferred
model of course is to install with the desired policy in the first
place. IIUC Android upgrades are a bit different in that they reboot
into recovery mode, create the new filesystem (required anyway for
dm-verity) with the correct labels for its policy, and then reboot
into normal mode.

I don't think the separate autorelabel service can work for whole
policy changeovers; it would need to be done directly by systemd
itself prior to any other actions.  I think Android's init does
something like that for the userdata partition since that doesn't get
replaced on upgrades.
