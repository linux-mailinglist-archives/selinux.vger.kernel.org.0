For whatever it is worth, I've always thought of the SELinux network
access controls as being composed of two parts: socket layer controls
and packet layer controls (or per-packet controls).  The packet layer
controls are further divided into the "peer" and "secmark" controls.

The socket layer controls are the access controls which closely mimic
the socket syscalls and typically involve checking if a running task
can perform an operation on a network socket, e.g. bind().  These are
usually easy to understand and don't require any special network
configuration.

The packet layer controls are where things start to get interesting as
this is where we apply SELinux security policy to individual packets
as they flow into, out of, and through the system.  As mentioned
above, the packet layer controls are comprised of both "peer" and
"secmark" controls.  The "peer" controls are those access controls
which compare the security attributes (SELinux label) of the sending
peer with the security context of the receiving peer.  The "secmark"
controls compare the network attributes (e.g. IP header values) with
the sending or receiving task's security attributes.  It get's very
complicated very quickly, but a simple example is to think of the
"peer" access controls as restricting firefox_t to talking only to
httpd_t, while the "secmark" access controls restrict firefox_t to
talking only to network services on TCP port 80.

Secmark is (obviously) the "secmark" access controls.

Labeled IPsec and the NetLabel framework are the current "peer" access
controls, with NetLabel supporting CIPSO for IPv4, CALIPSO for IPv6,
and a fallback/static labeling for unlabeled IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

Using your terminology, NetLabel is external or "labeled networking".

NetLabel is a framework for explicit network labeling that abstracts
away the underlying labeling protocol from the LSMs.  It provides
CIPSO, CALIPSO, and fallback/static protocol support to SELinux (and
Smack).
