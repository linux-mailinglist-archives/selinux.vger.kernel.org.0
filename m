Creating RWX source page requires PROCESS_EXECMEM. But as I responded to Sean earlier, I think his proposal of "aggregating" all "initial" permission checks into a single SIGSTRUCT check is probably a better approach.

This is exactly what I was thinking. But with Sean's proposal this is probably no longer necessary.

In the context of SELinux, new types could be defined to be associated with SIGSTRUCT (or more precisely, files containing SIGSTRUCTs). Then the LSM hook (I'd propose security_sgx_initialize_enclave) could enforce whatever...

I'd just use /dev/sgx/enclave to govern "runtime" permissions any EPC page can mmap()/mprotect() to. Then we won't need any code changes in LSM.
