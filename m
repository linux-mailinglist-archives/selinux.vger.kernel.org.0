Hi Stephen

Sorry for late reply, but before replying, I wanted to finish the
prototype of an alternative solution to this feature, which I was
already working on, but I got stuck on other tasks. The performance
metrics of this solution can be found below.

The main reasons to move filename transitions to avtab were to solve
issues that arise due to the separation of filename type transitions
from other type enforcement rules, which Ondrej also mentioned to me in
person while discussing this idea. By moving the filename transitions
closer to other rules, we can:

- reduce the technical debt in the code,
- support type attributes as other rules do (this could also reduce
  number of required rules),
- make other improvements easier, namely prefix/suffix matching or
  supporting filename transitions in conditional avtab as proposed by
  Christian [1].

These improvements come at a price. However, much of the performance
loss is reclaimed by simply converting the policy to the new format.
Only its size on the disk stays the same without modifying the rules.

Here are the performance metrics of a prototype solution, where the
filename transition key is extended with match_type and match is found
by shortening the name from the end or the beginning if a full match is
not found.

I had not considered this approach in the beginning, but as I thought
about it, it did not seem as simple.

For example, along with adding the wildcard character, we also need to
add the ability to escape it; otherwise, it would be a weird edge case
of an unsupported filename. Also, possibly to escape the escape
character itself. This adds more complexity to the solution.

In addition to this, extending such solution to support wildcards
anywhere in the filename would also require reimplementing the filename
transitions structures or moving rules with wildcards away from current
filename transitions. Currently, the filename is part of the hashtab key
and prefix/suffix could work by checking all prefixes and suffixes of a
filename, which there are not that many. However, with a wildcard at any
position, this is not feasible.
