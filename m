I recall encountering this sporadically, but I admit that it has been a
while since I supressed it in policy. I might try to reproduce. AFAIK my
policy is the only policy that actually labels some trees on cgroup2 fs
with private types currently.

Agree but 1. would require regex/glob support for genfscon and 2. these
files aren't "created" by userspace AFAIK and so setfscreatecon or
automatic object type transitions are probably not an option here.

Yes AFAIK it is the former (psuedo filesystem similar to procfs, debugfs
in that sense). This is also why I don't think that the PR mentioned is
tested because cgroup2 fs labeling is done with genfscon and not fsuse
trans or fsuse xattr so even if the files would be created by
userspace (which I think is not the case) the specified automatic object
type transition rule wouldnt work.

I think eventually we currently probably have little choice but to make sys=
temd
reset the context of said cgroup file manually. Just wanted to see if
there are alternatives.
