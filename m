Hello,

As far as I understand, the choice of using /usr/bin/env or not in the
shebang of a script depends on how you want your dependencies to load
on a system:

* Using "/usr/bin/env python3" (or with python or python2) allows
using a virtualenv where all Python dependencies are installed. It
makes it easier for two projects that require conflicting version of
their dependencies to be used together on a system, and it makes it
possible for an unprivileged user to use this script without requiring
an administrator to install dependencies in system-wide directories
(like /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/).
* Using "/usr/bin/python3" makes sense when you want the script to use
the dependencies that have been installed system-wide, for example
using packages from your distribution. This way, you kind-of control
which version of the dependencies are used: they are the one that are
packaged by the distribution. This is why it makes sense for Fedora's
guidelines to prefer this other /usr/bin/env.

By the way, I just got back from some holidays and I am reading the
messages from the mailing list after 1-2 months away. Therefore I
might have missed some context in your question that would make my
answer look like I am answering to something else. Sorry about that.

Best,
Nicolas
