I tried this out:

1. you can't create files on cgroupfs so adding support for transitions
does not seem to make a whole lot of sense to me

2. you can add a `fsuse trans "cgroup2"` statement in policy instead of a
`genfscon "cgroup2"` statement but it does not make sense as you cannot
create files on there anyway.

3. the PR mentioned is probably untested because type transitions do not wo=
rk
