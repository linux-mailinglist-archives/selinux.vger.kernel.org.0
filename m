With all due respect, I understand your point very well, I'm simply
trying to explain to you the position that the Linux Kernel has
historically taken with respect to out-of-tree and in-development
code.

It does *not* prevent new LSM modules from being merged upstream.

It may make it more difficult for out-of-tree modules to remain
out-of-tree, but that is both not a concern of the upstream community
nor is it the concern you are currently describing.

That is correct.  In order to have a LSM identifier token the LSM must
be upstream.

First, new LSMs generally do not need extensive userspace
modifications; of course there may be some, but when one considers the
entirety of a modern Linux distribution the actual percentage should
be quite small.  In addition, it is not uncommon for in-development
LSMs to have a set of privately, i.e. not upstreamed, patched
userspace tools while the new LSM works to get upstream.  These
private userspace patches are generally merged after the LSM has been
merged into the kernel.

> You are trying to force CONFIG_MODULES=n by just "we don't care about out-of-tree code".

That is not the goal at all and I would appreciate it if you could
stop slandering the motivations of the LSM syscall effort.

> Trying to change identifier from name to integer is a serious bug.

I disagree.  One would have a similar problem - userspace
awareness/enablement - regardless of if a name or a token is used.
Ultimately the challenge is getting userspace developers to accept a
change that is not part of the upstream Linux Kernel and thus not
guaranteed under the usual "don't break userspace" kernel API promise.
