Lack of PAM support or misconfigurated PAM config (pam_selinux needs to
be present in the appropriate PAM stacks)

You start by determining the current context of the login user (id -Z
will print the context of the current shell). Then you determine the
context of the directory in which the file is created (ls -dZ)

With this information you can query:

sesearch -T -s "type returned by id -Z" | grep "type returned by ls -dZ"

That should return any existing "type_transition" rules where the type
of the user is the source and the type of the destination directory is a target

The question is whether you want/need IBAC/RBAC on an embedded device
with only one user (root)

In my policy for OpenWrt (which is a embedded wireless router firmare) i
do not use IBAC/RBAC either and i just add a rule that say's when the
login program (sshd) executes a shell then assume that this is a login
user shell and automatically transition from the sshd context to a specified
user context)

On embedded devices "modular reference policy" does not make sense to
use (these devices generally do not have the resources to compile/link
policy at runtime) IMHO and the "monolithic reference policy" does not work well with
PAM and users.

But, yes, if you want modular refpolicy on a multi-user system then you
probably want PAM
