Assuming that sgx_enclave_load() is a LSM hook (probably named 
security_enclave_load() instead), then:

a) Does the sigstruct file get passed to this hook in every case, even 
when vma is NULL?  I think the answer is yes, just want to confirm.

b) Should we use a different hook for ACTIVATE_REGION than for 
ADD_REGION or is the distinction between them irrelevant/unnecessary 
from an access control point of view? At present LSM/SELinux won't be 
able to distinguish ACTIVATE_REGION(vma, RW) from ADD_REGION(NULL) above 
since they will both invoke the same hook with the same arguments IIUC. 
Does it matter?  It's ok if the answer is no, just want to confirm.

c) Is there still also a separate security_enclave_init() hook that will 
be called, and if so, how does it differ and when is it called relative 
to security_enclave_load()?

d) What checks were you envisioning each of these calls making?

With the separate security_enclave_*() hooks, we could define and use 
new ENCLAVE__* permissions, e.g. ENCLAVE__LOAD, ENCLAVE__INIT, 
ENCLAVE__EXECUTE, ENCLAVE__EXECMEM, ENCLAVE__EXECMOD, if we want to 
distinguish these operations from regular file mmap/mprotect operations.
