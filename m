I really don't want the take away from this to be that speaking up
about potential issues is a bad thing.  It's far better to address
issues, even if they ultimately turn out to be nothing, *before* they
go up to Linus' tree rather than afterwards.  If folks start holding
back their comments for fear of a patch being held for revision,
rejected, dropped, or reverted, then we potentially set ourselves up
for failure in the future with ourselves, our users, and the kernel
development community as a whole; all of those possibilities are far
worse than what we are dealing with now.

If anything, the fault in this particular case was mine for not
reviewing the patch as thoroughly as I should have done; I was trying
to make sure we got things merged before the end of -rc5 and in my
haste I rushed through the review.  My apologies on that, I was
impatient and it caused confusion and extra work for everyone.

> Revert coming up...

This is something that might be worth a more general discussion among
the userspace folks, but moving forward it might be good policy to not
merge userspace changes that rely on kernel API magic numbers until
the associated kernel patch ends up in a tagged release from Linus.
Of course one could always merge the patches into a "dev", "staging",
or topic branch for ease of testing and later merge it into the
default branch.  Just a thought.

Yes, what we have in the kernel now is what we need to stick with
moving forward.  While consistency with POSIX is a nice goal,
consistency with the existing kernel code is the most important thing.
