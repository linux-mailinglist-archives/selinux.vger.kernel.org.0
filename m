Agreed.  The concept in the kernel is "capability over a namespace."

That being said, sticking a flexible object type into ns_capable()
seems prematurely general to me.  How about adding
security_capable_wrt_inode_uidgid() and allowing LSMs to hook that?
The current implementation would go into commoncap.  The obvious
extensions I can think of are security_dac_read_search(..., inode,
...) and security_dac_override(..., inode, ...).  (Or dentry or
whatever is appropriate.)

If this patch were restructured like that, the semantics would be
obvious, and it would arguably be a genuine cleanup instead of a whole
new mechanism of unknown scope.
