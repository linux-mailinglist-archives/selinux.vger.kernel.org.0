Based on other comments in this thread it doesn't appear that there is
anyone using it, or at least not a significant percentage of users.  I
get that sometimes we need to interpolate/extrapolate a bit to
understand what users are actually doing, especially with certain
security-focused users, but I think you extrapolated (or assumed) a
bit too much in this case.  Please be more clear when you are
speculating in the future, there may be folks reading these mailing
lists that don't have the background or understanding to tell
assumptions from actual truth.
