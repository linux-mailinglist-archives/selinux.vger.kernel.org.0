We did it in DTOS, a predecessor to Flask which was a predecessor to
SELinux.  It had a per-file visible permission that controlled
visibility of the file name.  However, you then had various
complications, e.g. what if a process at another level tries to create
a file with the same name (create a new file with that name magically
extended with a label suffix that is hidden from userspace? deny it
thereby giving away its existence?), and there were still ways of
detecting the presence of hidden subdirectories/files (e.g. checking
the link count on the directory, checking the size of the directory,
looking for gaps in the offsets returned by getdents()).  I also seem
to recall someone proposing a LSM hook for filtering directories but
didn't see it on a quick glance at the linux-security-module archives
on lore (but those are unfortunately limited to the last few years).
