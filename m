It's too soon for me to start worrying about this but:

I don't care if my dssp5 policy breaks due to this regression (that is
what it is) because other than me no one probably uses it, but I also
maintain a policy for OpenWrt which relies on this functionality (or
allowing duplicate blocks, macros) and I would not want to have this
break there come 3.3.
