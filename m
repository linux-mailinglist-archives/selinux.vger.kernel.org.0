Perhaps TEE_*, since it is generic and expresses the notion of
privileges specific to an alternate execution environment.

Indeed.

Most importantly, it is decidedly unfriendly to the future of the
technology on Linux.

More problematically, from a development perspective, the driver is
incompatible with the current Intel runtime, which makes testing at a
level beyond the one page test harness that is included with the
patchset impossible.

As I noted previously, before the LSM discussion, we have a patch that
addresses the compatibility, security and launch control issues the
original version of the driver had.  If you missed the thread, it is
available from the following URL:

ftp://ftp.idfusion.net/pub/idfusion/jarkko-master-SFLC.patch

It will be a bit dated by now and doesn't address the API change
needed to set page permissions.  It is a pretty solid starting point
if you want to use the existing runtime to do more then trivial
testing.

We have an extension to the existing driver that we will be releasing,
so users of our SRDE will be able to use both the out-of-tree and
in-tree drivers.  It also re-establishes launch control and provides a
very simplistic interface to implement ring-0 security for launch
control on flexible launch control platforms.

I'm in Israel right now but we should have a GIT tree against the
current development branches by the weekend.  We will be testing the
driver with our SRDE against real world enclaves as we advance the
driver forward.

Have a good day.
