Recognizing that re-basing the selinux namespace patches on top of these 
two patches might be painful, I went ahead and did so; the result can be 
found here:

https://github.com/stephensmalley/selinux-kernel/tree/working-selinuxns-rebase

The two patches that required manual fix-ups were the first one 
("selinux: rename selinux state to ns (namespace)") and the third one 
("selinux: dynamically allocate selinux namespace"). The rest re-based 
without conflicts.Â  The resulting tree built, booted, passed the 
selinux-testsuite, and I could successfully follow the instructions to 
create a new namespace and load a policy into it. As before, the child 
namespace won't be usable if you switch it to enforcing mode since we 
haven't yet revived the per-namespace support for inode and superblock 
security blobs and it is still very unsafe to use in its current form.
