The situation has changed a bit since that was written, though... Back
then after the policy had been loaded there was no way to turn back
and if sel_make_policy_nodes() failed, the new policy would stay and
selinuxfs would have been left behind in an inconsistent/broken state.
Now this issue is fixed and the new policy isn't actually applied
until the selinuxfs preparation succeeds. So from a certain POV, the
selinuxfs failure is no longer that fatal and could just print a
warning like the other error path, because the result is the same
after both failures (active policy and selinuxfs state remains
unchanged).

Paul (or Stephen if you are reading this and have time to comment),
what do you think?
