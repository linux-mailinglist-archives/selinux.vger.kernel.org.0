This example CIL policy takes a different approach:

1. Leverages CIL
2. Installs using semodule to make it tunable at runtime (but you can obviously also use secilc to build a monolithic version and deploy that)
3. Makes few assumptions about variables
4. Leverages handleunknown allow and declares least required access vectors so that you can pick and choose which access vectors you want to use and ignore the remainder
5. Leverages unlabeled and file ISID and makes no assumptions about any volatile filesystems you may or may not use
6. As small and simple as reasonably possible, heavily documented
7. Modern, Requires SELinux 3.1

v2: rename XWAYLAND.md to XSERVER_XWAYLAND.md and cover both Xserver as well as Xwayland
V3: fix typo in XSERVER_XWAYLAND.md and exclude x_contexts altogether
v4: remove XSERVER_XWAYLAND and add the note to README.md, redo README.md and clean up cil-policy.cil

+There is another CIL policy in the notebook examples called
+"cil-policy" that takes a slightly different approach where the goal
+is to keep the policy as simple as possible. It requires `semodule`,
+Linux 5.7, SELinux 3.1 and can be installed by executing
+`make install`. It leverages some modern SELinux features, most
+notably where the requirement for ordered security classes is lifted.
+With this you are no longer expected to be aware of all the access
+vectors managed by Linux in order to align your security class
+declarations with the order in which they are declared in the kernel.
+A module store is created by `semodule` to give easy access to the
+source and that allows for full control over the policy.

+# Tiny CIL policy that is mutable at runtime
+
+The purpose of this tiny SELinux policy is to demonstrate what is
+least required to get started, and it can be used as a base for your
+own security policy or just to experiment with. The policy is written
+in Common Intermediate Language and is installed with semodule to
+provide easy access to all aspects at runtime.
+
+A single security context is provided that is associated with
+everything in memory only and to really get started you are expected
+to make an inventory of your filesystems and to enable labeling
+support for your filesystems accordingly before you proceed.
+
+Only eight security classes and two access vector permissions are
+declared. AVC allow rules for these two access vector permissions are
+associated with the single security context to give full access.
+Unknown access vectors are allowed to enable you to pick and choose
+which access vectors to leverage. You can get a list of unknown Linux
+security classes and access vector permissions from `dmesg`, and any
+user space object managers are likely to report unknown access vectors
+using either "USER_AVC" or "USER_SELINUX_ERR" type audit records. You
+are expected to declare any access vectors you require and then to
+associate them accordingly with access vector rules to allow access.
+
+The type-enforcement (TE), as well as identity-based (IBAC) and
+role-based (RBAC) access control security models are enabled. Optional
+security models such as multi-level security can be added with
+relative easy.
+
+Common Intermediate Language is a modern source based policy language
+that together with a module store that can be accessed with `semodule`
+at runtime provides optimal flexibility in your interactions with
+SELinux. It is recommended that you use the `setools` policy analysis
+suite to its full potential to get any information about the state of
+your policy.
+
+The cil-policy addresses some of the intricacies involved with getting
+started without making assumptions about your environment and
+requirements. You are enouraged to leverage CIL to its full potential
+and to keep its documentation handy.
+
+## Getting started
+
+```
+make install
+cat > /etc/selinux/config <<EOF
+SELINUX=enforcing
+SELINUXTYPE=cil-policy
+EOF
+```
+
+If you are switching to cil-policy from another policy then a system
+reboot is not strictly required:
+
+```
+semodule -B
+```
+
+Your first step to actually leverage cil-policy will likely be to
+enable labeling support for at least your non-volatile filesystems
+and to apply labels according to the file context specifications
+defined in the policy.
+
+For example if you use `ext4` filesystems:
+
+```
+echo '(fsuse xattr "ext4" (sys.id sys.role sys.isid ((s0)(s0))))' > myfs.cil
+semodule -i myfs.cil
+fixfiles onboot && reboot
+```
+
+To modify the existing cil-policy:
+
+```
+semodule -E cil-policy
+emacs cil-policy.cil
+semodule -X 101 -i cil-policy.cil
+```
+
+Use your favorite text editor to write policy in [Common Intermediate Language](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/master/secilc/docs/README.md),
+manage it with `semodule`, and analyze it with `setools`.
+
+## Important
+
+If you are using Xserver or Xwayland then the following is required:
+
+```
+echo "(boolean xserver_object_manager false)" > disablexace.cil
+semodule -i disablexace.cil
+```
