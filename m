I am confident that, if were talking about socket activation, this is
not the case. systemd will create, and listen on the socket with the contex=
t of the
domain that will "accept" the connection.

for example i have a mpd instance that is socket activated:

root@brutus:~# ss -antlpZ | grep 6600
LISTEN 0      5                  *:6600            *:*
users:(("systemd",pid=3D968,proc_ctx=3Dwheel.id:wheel.role:user.systemd.sub=
j:s0,fd=3D33))

systemd is listening on behalf of mpd.

if i query the policy:

root@brutus:~# sesearch -A -s user.systemd.subj -t user.systemd.subj -c
tcp_socket

... nothing returns. systemd is not allowed to create tcp_socket with
its own domain type or listen on them. Yes it is still listening on
tcp:6600

this is because:

root@brutus:~# sesearch -A -s user.systemd.subj -t user.mpd.subj -c tcp_soc=
ket
allow user.systemd.subj user.systemd.socketactivated.tcp.typeattr:tcp_socke=
t { append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl listen read setattr set=
opt shutdown write };

this systemd created a tcp_socket with type user.mpd.subj (on behalf of
mpd) and listens for connections on that tcp_socket. Once a connection
comes in then mpd with accept it (not that user.systemd.subj is not
allowed to accept tcp_socket on behalf of mpd (or any tcp_socket for
that matter:

root@brutus:~# sesearch -A -s user.systemd.subj -t user.mpd.subj -c
tcp_socket -p accept

... nothing returned.
