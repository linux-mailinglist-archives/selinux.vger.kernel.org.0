Except that mmap() is more or less required to guarantee that ELRANGE
established by ECREATE is available.  And we want to disallow mmap() as
soon as the first EADD is done so that userspace can't remap the enclave's
VMAs via munmap()->mmap() and gain execute permissions to pages that were
EADD'd as NX.

Actually, conceptually it's probably more intuitive to disallow mmap() at
ECREATE, i.e. the act of creating an enclave pins the associated virtual
address range until the enclave is destroyed.
