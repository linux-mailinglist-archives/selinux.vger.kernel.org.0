^"the integrity of the system."

This cover letter needs to be re-written from a higher perspective,
explaining what is meant by "critical data" (e.g. kernel subsystem
specific information only stored in kernel memory).

True, up until recently IMA only measured files, nothing else.  Why is
this paragraph needed?  What new information is provided?

Perhaps, something more along the lines, "This patch set defines a new
IMA hook named ... to measure critical data."

Reverse the order of this paragraph and the following one, describing
the new feature and only afterwards explaining how it may be
constrained.

This patch set must include at least one example of measuring critical
data, before it can be upstreamed.  Tushar, please coordinate with
Lakshmi and Raphael.

thanks,

Mimi
