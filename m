I don't really understand Casey's position.  I also wouldn't necessarily 
view his opinion on the matter as necessarily authoritative since he is 
not the LSM maintainer as far as I know although he has contributed a 
lot of changes in recent years.

I understood the architecture of the original EMA implementation (i.e. a 
support library to be used by the security modules to help them in 
implementing their own access control policies), although I do have some 
concerns about the complexity and lifecycle issues, and wonder if a 
simpler model as suggested by Dr. Greg isn't feasible.

I'd also feel better if there was clear consensus among all of the 
@intel.com participants that this is the right approach. To date that 
has seemed elusive.

If there were consensus that the EMA approach was the right one and that 
a simpler model is not feasible, and if the only obstacle to adopting 
EMA was Casey's objections, then I'd say just put it directly into 
SELinux and be done with it.  I originally thought that was a mistake 
but if other security modules don't want the support, so be it.
