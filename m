If you ever feel like CIL doesn't quite do what you need or that it
doesn't work as expected, please let me know.

I realize that many of my questions below will be answered with
"future work", so don't feel like you need to explain in great detail
if that is the case.

How different is the inheritance in Cascade as compared to CIL.
Obviously, in CIL it is not required, where in Cascade it is a very
important part. There is also the use of "this" in Cascade.

It seems like Cascade is resolving all of its inheritance before
writing out the CIL. My guess is that inheritance is such a core part
of Cascade that using CIL's inheritance would make no sense. Is that
true? Or did you just not like the way CIL does it?

I was surprised that casc only take a single file. Do you expect the
policies to be simple enough to do in one file?

Since there is only one file, I guess there is no concept of modules
for Cascade? And this means there is no need for something like an
optional block because all of the policy would be compiled at once?

It looks like classes, mls statements, and sids are all automatically
created in CIL. Is there a way to specify these things in Cascade or,
since these things are almost always the same, are these low-level
details something Cascade is not worried about.

What about roles and users. I see the keywords, but how are they going to work?

Thanks for letting us know about this work. It looks interesting.
Jim
