Hmm, that's clever.  Although it seems plausible that an LSM would
want to allow RX or RWX of a given file page but only in the context
of an approved enclave, so I think it should still be its own hook.

 So I don't think there's anything needed to done here.

Duh.  So security_enclave_load_zeros() for EAUG.  See below.

we've discussed before. For those who can't recall, the major reason is tha=

ve (or at least I don't want to prevent anyone from doing so), which could =
also be part of another file, such as a shared object or even the main exec=

I'm okay with this, except for one nastiness: there's a big difference
between a file that is just a sigstruct and a file that contains
essentially arbitrary data plus a sigstruct at an arbitrary offset.
We could do something tricky like saying that SIGSTRUCT can be in a
file that's just a SIGSTRUCT or it can be in a special SIGSTRUCT ELF
note in a file that isn't just a SIGSTRUCT, but that could be
annoyingly restrictive.

If it's going to be in an arbitrary file, then I think the signature
needs to be more like:

int security_enclave_init(struct vm_area_struct *sigstruct_vma, loff_t
sigstruct_offset, const sgx_sigstruct *sigstruct);

So that the LSM still has the opportunity to base its decision on the
contents of the SIGSTRUCT.  Actually, we need that change regardless.

I find the SDM's discussion of EAUG, EACCEPT, and EACCEPTCOPY to be
extremely confusing.  My copy of the SDM has EACCEPT's SECINFO
argument as "Read access permitted by Non Enclave".  Is that an error?
 And is EACCEPTCOPY just EACCEPT + memcpy or is there some other
fundamental difference?  38.5.7 doesn't even mention EACCEPTCOPY.

Anyway, all my confusion aside, I was talking about the page table,
not the EPCM.  I think the enclave should need permission to write its
own content into a page that will ever become X, and the enclave's
untrusted host library would do this by adding the page with
MAXPERM=3DRWX and then mapping/mprotecting it as PROT_WRITE and then
(later or simultaneously) PROT_EXEC.

Since SGX2 doesn't seem to have a way to add an initialized page to
EPC after an enclave starts, I guess that it's impossible to have the
enclave do something like dlopen() without MAXPERM=3DRWX.  So be it.
Maybe someone will find this annoying someday and SGX3 will add
EAUG-but-don't-zero and EACCEPT-with-existing-contents.

Sure, I suppose the same hook with NULL parameters would be equivalent.

As above, I think I disagree.  MAXPERM is intended as an upper bound
on the permissions that a page can ever have, at least until it's
EREMOVEd and re-added.  Since there's no EAUG-but-don't-zero, EAUG
with MAXPERM.W=3D0 is basically useless because the page can never
contain anything other than zeros, so a dynamically allocated page
that is ever executed has to have MAXPERM=3DRWX or MAXPERM=3DWX.  And that
will need special permissions, which I think is consistent with your
recent emails on how this could all map to SELinux permissions.

I'm confused.  Things like MRSIGNER aren't known until the SIGSTRUCT
shows up.  Also, security_enclave_load() provides no protection
against loading a mishmash of two different enclave files.  I see
security_enclave_init() as "verify this SIGSTRUCT against your policy
on who may sign enclaves and/or grant EXECMOD depending on SIGSTRUCT"
and security_enclave_load() as "implement your EXECMOD / EXECUTE /
WRITE / whatever policy and possibly check enclave files for some
label."

Hmm.  If we want to make this distinction, we need something a big
richer than my proposed callbacks.  A check of the actual mprotect() /
mmap() permissions would also be needed.  Specifically, allowing
MAXPERM=3DRWX wouldn't imply that PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC is allowed.
