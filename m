That's correct, everything seems A-OK in permissive mode, and starts to
get denied (likely correctly) in enforcing mode.

Just tried that, thank you for the suggestion! I don't see any
additional logging, but I'm going to follow up more comprehensively
after reading the documentation. I'll give this a stronger go tonight.

Ah! This makes _so much_ sense. I was wondering where rules defining
this behavior lived. Looks like it's a (very comprenstive?) RH specific
changeset that we don't carry in Debian. I've got some work cut out for
me from the looks of it.

I started to graft sections I thought were relevent from policy-rhel-7.2-ba=
se.patch
into my local policies, but I think I'm super in over my head. This is
likely going to take me some time to work through, but it's monumentally
helpful. I was only looking at the upstream rules and our package, which
explains why I was missing a lot of this.

I assume since this is being maintained by a lot of folks working
upstream too which makes me suspect this is a WONTFIX situation
with the upstream rules. Seems like I ought to tread lightly here.

I was sniffing from the VM Host (a laptop) to see what was coming in/out
of the network when I tried to initiate an SSH connection from the LAN
to the VM, since that *should* be unlabeled and pass through (although
given the bit above about the default unlabeled rules, it's likely
getting filtered out).

I was trying to minimally set up labeling for localhost (without
impacting the LAN NIC) to make a baby step in enabling NetLabel with
enforcement on, and still allowing network I/O except where I was
placing specific rules in place.

I believe so, but I wasn't sniffing inside the VM because my SELinux
rules need to be fixed :)

It certently works in permissive mode, and I'd expect it works in
enforcing mode, but it's tough to tell right now. I'll see if I can put
a rule in place to start up a getpeercon daemon and see what it says.

Roger that :)

Will do, I'll dig deeper, and come back with something a bit more
specific. I think between that and the unlabelednet module, I've got
some debugging to do.
