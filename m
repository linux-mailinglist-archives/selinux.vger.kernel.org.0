The credential-changing SELinux-aware program is getting
invoked by an unprivileged, Smack aware program? Would anyone
expect that to be a good idea? I'll admit it could happen,
but setting the Smack label of your SELinux-aware program
(which will need CAP_MAC_ADMIN, BTW) to "system_u:system_r:wheehee_t"
is unlikely to result in anything other than your SELinux-aware
program getting very frustrated. In the other direction, a
Smack-aware program that trys to set its SELinux context to "^"
is going to fail by SELinux policy. While I am willing to accept
that it is possible that there is a way to exploit this, it
would require convoluted SELinux and Smack policies. Anyone
who has reason to use a combination of Smack and SELinux on
a real system is already signing up for more configuration
headaches than I would wish on anyone.
=C2=A0
I have strongly advocated addition of /proc/.../attr/
subdirectories for all LSMs, and that all user space migrate
to using them. /proc/.../attr/selinux/current would not be
affected by the display setting. We know, and have known for
years that so long as "current" is shared there will be this
sort of problem.

What would you propose as a more rational behavior?
Seriously, I could use some help here.

Binder needs another look then.

I would love to get feedback from the audit maintainers about
how they would like the multiple LSM data formatted.

NFS is ... challenging. It was supposed to work with Smack
when it went in, but to the best of my understanding never
actually demonstrated.

Agreed in principle, not necessarily in detail.
