Agreed.  Without reviewing the patch set in depth, I'm not quite sure
why this patch set needs to be limited to measuring just LSM critical
data and can't be generalized.    The patch set could be titled "ima:
measuring critical data" or "ima: measuring critical kernel data". 
Measuring SELinux critical data would be an example of its usage.

For an example, refer to the ima_file_check hook, which is an example
of IMA being called directly, not via an LSM hook.
