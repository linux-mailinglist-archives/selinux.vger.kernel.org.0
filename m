Which is a reason why tracefs is root only.

The "%p" gets obfuscated when printed from the trace file by default
now. But they are consistent (where the same pointer shows up as the
same hash).

It's used mainly to map together events. For example, if you print the
address of a skb in the networking events, it's good to know what
events reference the same skb, and the pointer is used for that.
