You lost me here.  What operation triggers this callback?  And
wouldn't sgx_enclave_load(NULL, RX) sometimes be a transition from RO
or just some fresh executable zero bytes?

In the maxperm model, this mprotect() will fail unless MAXPERM
contains RX, which could only happen if MAXPERM=3DRWX.  So, regardless
of how it's actually mapped to SELinux policy, MAXPERM=3DRWX is
functionally like EXECMOD and actual RWX PTEs are functionally like
EXECMEM.

Sure it can!  You just have a hypervisor that maps a PA bit to EPT
no-read.  Then you can use that PA bit to suppress read.  Also, Linux
already abuses PKRU to simulate XO, although that won't work for
enclaves.

I may be misunderstanding or just be biased to my own proposal, but
this seems potentially more complicated and less flexible than the
MAXPERM model.  One of the main things that made me come up with
MAXPERM is that I wanted to avoid any complicated PTE/VMA modification
or runtime changes.  So, with MAXPERM, we still need to track the
MAXPERM bits per page, but we don't ever need to *change* them or to
worry about what is or is not mapped anywhere at any given time.  With
ACTIVATE_REGION, don't we need to make sure that we don't have a
second VMA pointing at the same pages?  Or am I just confused?

I may still be missing something, but, for SGX1, it's possible at
least in principle for the enclave to request, via ocall or similar,
that the untrusted runtime do mprotect().  It's not even such a bad
idea.  Honestly, enclaves *shouldn't* have anything actually writable
and executable at once because the enclaves don't want to be easily
exploited.
