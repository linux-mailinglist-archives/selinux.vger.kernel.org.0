I understand that current state is that one needs to choose either
genfscon or fs_use_xattr depending on filesystem type. Will be nice
if this was more flexibile.

If virtiofsd is running on top of a filesystem which does not support
xattr, then also virtiofs mount will fail.

IOW, with virtiofs both kind of configurations can be easily produed
(xattr enabled or disabled). So none of the defaults (genfscon or
fs_use_xattr) seems to be ideal.

IIUC, policy is assuming that virtiofs will either always support xattr
or will not always support xattrs. Which probably is true for many
filesystems. But not necessarily in this case. So hard coding one
assumption will break other configurations. It will be nice if we there
is a way to fix this in policy.

Thanks
