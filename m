It should be noted that this is also just for legacy, we agreed
last year that smack and apparmor would move to new none shared
interfaces by default, and ideally other LSMs would as well.
Smack has already added its process dir and apparmor has its
in apparmor-next

The display LSM allows for the current interfaces to be used
in a stacking situation for things like LSM in legacy container.

This is the part of the patchset that I am least happy with but
it is a hard problem, and so far using display has been the only
option that has been even sort of agreed to.


>> 4) A security_secid_to_secctx() in one process' context (e.g. sender) or with one display value followed later by a security_secctx_to_secid() call in a different process' context (e.g. receiver) or with a different display value may ask a different security module to perform the reverse translation of the context than the forward translation.

If we could it would be better, but again how to do it. Every
option presented has been rejected.

Yes. Just because it isn't currently used doesn't mean it isn't
a concern or desired.

I'm not even sure we want to teach systemd et al. about it,
it would be far better to teach them about
  /proc/*/attr/{smack,apparmor,...}/*


But yes its going to take time to get the userspace updated.
