This is not an issue with just podman.  Podman can mount the image and
the tools can just read/write content into the mountpoint.

I thought I recalled a LSM that prefented symlink attacks when users
would link a file in the homedir against /etc/shadow and then attempt to
get the admin to modify the file in his homedir?

I was thinking that if that existed we could build more controls on it
based on Labels rather then just UIDs matching.
