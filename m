As mentioned in the commit description, that was intentional.  I
wanted to keep the removal of the SELinux hook implementation separate
from any core LSM changes.

At some point in the future we can consider dropping the, rather
small, core LSM changes.  However it is my opinion that if we are
going to do that we should move the lockdown LSM functionality out of
the LSM and into the core kernel.  If Linus is effectively only going
to allow a single lockdown security model I feel the lockdown calls
shouldn't be part of the LSM.

Regardless, this patch is now merged into selinux/next.
