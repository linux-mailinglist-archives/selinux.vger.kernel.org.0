no, it _may_ need to be depending on the model/policy being used, and
an LSM is in the best place to make that decision and do it for its own
policy as long as the infrastructure supports it.

No an LSM is fully capable of doing this and honestly in a better
position to do so for its own policy than an external orchestrator.
Where coordination orchestration is need is at the infrastructure layer
(LSM), to ensure once everything is decided by inidivual LSMs that
what the security context is atomically setup correctly.

So in that sense the LSM infrastructure is an orchestrator, but only
in the loosest sense.

yes, it very much depends on the model. I would argue if the LSM needs
this.
1. the policy at the exec/fork/clone/unshare point already needs to
    be loaded.
2. the LSMs policy needs a way to initiate the transition. Eg. in
    the selinux case, the transition is setting up a new layer in
    mediation that will be bounded by the previous layers. There isn't
    a transition from one policy to another, but adding a new layer

the other resource namespaces being able to move independent of the
security namespace, or at least mediation by the security namespace is
a complete disaster and should not have ever been allowed.

There are different levels of verification. It makes sense to do some
of it in the individual LSM, some of it in userspace, and potentially
some at another level in another LSM. Unfortunately Linux has forced the
concept of containers to be a user level construct, and this forces
certain verifications around containers to be in userspace.

AppArmor does a policy verification checking that policy meet all the
bounding constraints etc. Is very different than the verification check
that IMA may doing check that this policy is blessed and allowed to be
loaded. AppArmor could support some IMA verification but is very much
designed to be like landlock in that unprivileged userspace _may_ have
privilege to load policy into the kernel. You may not want to allow
that on some systems, but you certainly do on others. The system level
signature check that IMA does isn't appropriate for unprivileged
user policy. But the apparmor verification check is.

and Yes something like IMA that is doing a system level integrity is going
to need a post policy load callback to do verification. This again doesn't
need an orchestrator, but just support in the infrastructure, and a
callback that individual LSMs can trigger. See the work Paul is doing
to rework the LSM init or how IMA is doing a verification of selinux
policy.

Of course you have to trust the LSMs to trigger the callback, but its
opersource and the code can be checked. If you can't trust the individual
LSMs you have a much bigger problem because you just can't trust a
monolithic kernel and you are going need a trust zone/hyper visor above
the kernel to do any form of integrity check you can trust.
