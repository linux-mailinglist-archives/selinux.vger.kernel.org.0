Ok, I finally realized that if you unshare the cgroup namespace and
then mount -t cgroup2 none /sys/fs/cgroup, it just mounts the
subdirectory for the cgroup to which your process was already assigned
- it doesn't create a new one. So if you cat /proc/self/cgroup before
doing the unshare -C and subsequently mount -t cgroup2 none
/sys/fs/cgroup, you are getting the same subdirectory that was already
set up by systemd on the host (ls -i of both directories will show the
same inodes). That's why the base files are all being labeled with
host labels, because the directory was created on the host. To avoid
this, you would need to create a new cgroup subdirectory on the host
after unsharing your SELinux namespace, assign your process to that
cgroup, and then unshare the cgroup namespace and mount the cgroup2
filesystem IIUC.
