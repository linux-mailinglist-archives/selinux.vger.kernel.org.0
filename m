I'm not sure checkpatch.pl is the right place for that anyway as every
list could have a different policy.

FWIW, many years ago I was told to keep the diffstat under a thousand
lines as a general rule.  While I've seen patches go over that limit
and hit various @vger lists, I personally try to keep my patches under
that 1k limit, and generally that isn't too hard.  This really is a
bit of a special case I think.

Thanks, I'll work from that.
