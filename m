for some users, but having a very well defined support surface also has its
place. From a distro POV support is expensive and its amazing what users
will do and try to hide while trying to get support.

Personally I prefer splitting enable and support but there are situations
where that isn't even allowed (some certifications). So I can understand
where they are coming from.

It just sucks for the users and projects that aren't "supported".

you are more optimistic than I am. What makes you think a distro like RH will
enable loading out-of-tree kernel modules if they aren't enabling TOMOYO
that is already in the kernel.

If loadable LSM modules are allowed, there will likely be a kernel config
to disable them and there will definitely be an interface that allows
blocking them. So whether via config option or run time control I don't
see RH allowing them.
