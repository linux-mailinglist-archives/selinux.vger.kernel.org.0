Yes, I'm probably underestimating the performance impact of the
change... I'm trying right now to collect some statistics to help
quantify the difference and try some optimization ideas.

Again, this is something that I will need to analyze via statistics
and think it through...

Yes, this feature remains relevant and no doubt would be very useful,
however I'm not sure how much work that would require... Implementing
even simplified regexes in the kernel sounds tricky... (or is there
already some library that we could use? I didn't check). But maybe in
the end it will be easier than going in the direction of this patch :)

I don't have a deep understanding of this, but I'm not sure if we can
reliably enforce correct devtmpfs labeling in userspace (at least in
Fedora). There shouldn't be too many services that need/may create
files in devtmpfs, so they should probably be fixed, but now we have a
chicken-and-egg problem: we can't remove the rules before all these
cases are found and fixed, but as long as the rules are there, there
is no push for the issues to be fixed...

I'll see if I can implement this without adding too much complexity
and without killing performance. If not, then I'll probably just give
up on this front...
