Sincere apologies Mimi.
We misunderstood your feedback when you mentioned -
"Unless this patch set is specifically dependent on the two patches in
the SELinux tree beyond v5.10.0-rc1, please base it on v5.10.0-rc1."

We believed you were recommending selinux repo as there were exactly
two patches present in the selinux/next branch after the tag v5.10-rc1.

Anyways - we tried applying the patches to -
repo: https://github.com/torvalds/linux
branch: master
tag: v5.10-rc1

and they get applied cleanly and are working fine.

We will wait for feedback on the v5 patch from you/Paul/Stephen, address
those, and then base v6 of the series to tarvolds/master branch on
v5.10-rc1 (or later).

Does it sound ok?

Here is the v5 of the series we published yesterday.

Thanks,
Tushar
