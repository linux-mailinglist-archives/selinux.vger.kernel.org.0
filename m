Sounds good to me.

That is one reason to use trace. I can be used for things that
generate a lot of data. Like memory allocations and scheduler etc,
and it is a developer tool so you should not have to worry about DOS etc.

Both netlink and android logging are too happy to throw away data for
developers to be happy.

I think that only work for rooted devices. Many application developers
run on commercial devices that are locked, but they do have access
to trace. But I have no idea if they (google) have intended the selinux traces to
available there.
