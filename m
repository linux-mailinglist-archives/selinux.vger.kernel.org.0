I don't believe CIPSO, CALIPSO, labeled IPsec and other IP-based
labeling protocols aren't really options here since VSOCK doesn't rely
on IP.  I vaguely recall thinking it was much more analogous to
UNIX/LOCAL sockets, but it has been ~seven years since I thought about
this last.

The use of secmark could be interesting assuming there are useful
labeling points for VSOCK and netfilter (secmark'ing a packet doesn't
rely on IP so it should be okay from that perspective).

Of course eBPF support would be interesting, but that is like saying
SELinux, Smack, and AppArmor support would be interesting.  I think
the important part is making sure the important objects include the
necessary opaque security blobs (we are probably okay there already),
and making sure we have the LSM hooks in the right places in the code
(also, we *may* be okay there).  Once those things are done, it's a
matter of adding the necessary support to each LSM.
