I couldn't understand the real intentions of ALLOW_* flags until I saw them in code. I have to say C is more expressive than English in that regard :)

Generally I agree with your direction but think ALLOW_* flags are completely internal to LSM because they can be both produced and consumed inside an LSM module. So spilling them into SGX driver and also user mode code makes the solution ugly and in some cases impractical because not every enclave host process has a priori knowledge on whether or not an enclave page would be EMODPE'd at runtime.

Theoretically speaking, what you really need is a per page flag (let's name it WRITTEN?) indicating whether a page has ever been written to (or more precisely, granted PROT_WRITE), which will be used to decide whether to grant PROT_EXEC when requested in future. Given the fact that all mprotect() goes through LSM and mmap() is limited to PROT_NONE, it's easy for LSM to capture that flag by itself instead of asking user mode code to provide it.

That said, here is the summary of what I think is a better approach.
* In hook security_file_alloc(), if @file is an enclave, allocate some data structure to store for every page, the WRITTEN flag as described above. WRITTEN is cleared initially for all pages.
  Open: Given a file of type struct file *, how to tell if it is an enclave (i.e. /dev/sgx/enclave)?
* In hook security_mmap_file(), if @file is an enclave, make sure @prot can only be PROT_NONE. This is to force all protection changes to go through security_file_mprotect().
* In the newly introduced hook security_enclave_load(), set WRITTEN for pages that are requested PROT_WRITE.
* In hook security_file_mprotect(), if @vma->vm_file is an enclave, look up and use WRITTEN flags for all pages within @vma, along with other global flags (e.g. PROCESS__EXECMEM/FILE__EXECMOD in the case of SELinux) to decide on allowing/rejecting @prot.
* In hook security_file_free(), if @file is an enclave, free storage allocated for WRITTEN flags. 

I'll try to make more detailed comments in my replies to individual patches sometime tomorrow.
