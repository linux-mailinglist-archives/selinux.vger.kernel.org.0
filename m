I guess the closest thing is the "c" argument of
rcu_dereference_protected(), which should be passed a
lock[dep]_is_held() check on the lock/mutex that provides the mutual
exclusion that is needed for the operation to be safe. If we ever do
conver the rwlock to RCU, we will need something to pass to
rcu_dereference_protected() anyway. (I mean we could cheat and just
pass 1 + a comment, but it would be nicer to put an actual
lock[dep]_held() check there.)

But it just occurred to me that we could make it even more explicit by
simply adding another "policy_load" mutex to security_ss and do most
of security_load_policy() with that mutex locked. Since there will
never be any contention on it, the extra overhead should be
negligible.
