FWIW, I think treating the per-task audit switch as a boolean is fine;
I don't think we want other in-kernel callers to have to worry about
the different audit states.  From their perspective it is either "on"
or "off".

However, I think there are two parts of the greater LSM-enables-audit
discussion, and we're only discussing the first part: collection.  The
second part is the actual audit record generation, and I think this
part is going to be less clear.  While the changes to audit_alloc(),
etc. are necessary to be able to do any meaningful audit later on, I'm
thinking introducing some granularity and LSM control to what gets
generated in audit_log_exit() might be very welcome both from a
performance and log cleanliness perspective.

Some random thoughts on this (some may be way off, but I want to start
with some expectations):
* The LSM should never be able to block collection/generation of audit
records, just enable additional records.
* The LSM controls should only affect what we call the "syscall
auditing" bits, e.g. the stuff in auditsc.c.  Audit records that
happen outside of this should be untouched, the AVC records are an
example of a record that exists independent of syscall auditing.
* We should be able to have the LSM set a per-syscall audit enable
flag which would be checked in audit_log_exit() (or
audit_free()/__audit_syscall_exit()).
* It's not clear to me if we want to provide some granularity to the
LSM regarding what records get generated in audit_log_exit(), for
example do we allow the LSM to request just PATH records?  I'm
guessing we wouldn't want to specify record types directly, but
perhaps record "classes", e.g. "file".

I'm not sure if any of this is going to be a good idea, but I think we
need to discuss it a bit before we start duplicating things in
lsm_audit.c.
