Stephen may correct me if I'm wrong. EXECMOD is granted to files, to 
indicate the bearer contains self-modifying code (or text relocation). 
So if it applies the enclaves, there are two aspects of it:

(1) An enclave may be loaded from multiple image files, among which some 
may contain self-modifying code and hence would require EXECMOD on each 
of them. At runtime, W->X will be allowed/denied for pages loaded from 
image files having/not having EXECMOD.

(2) But there are pages not loaded from any files - e.g. pages EAUG'ed 
at runtime. We are trying to use the file containing SIGSTRUCT as the 
"proxy file" - i.e. EXECMOD on the proxy file indicates the enclave may 
load code into EAUG'ed pages at runtime.

(3) Well, this is not an aspect of EXECMOD. Yet there's another category 
of pages - pages EADD'ed from anonymous memory. They are different than 
EAUG'ed pages in that their contents are supplied by untrusted code. How 
to control their accesses is still being debated. My argument was that 
the source pages must be executable before they could be loaded 
executable in EPC. Andy argued that SIGSTRUCT alone could be considered 
sufficient validation on the contents in certain usages, so both Sean 
and I had proposed PROCESS2__ENCLAVE_EXECANON as a new permission. But 
for the 1st upstream I think we all agree to do just the minimum until 
real requirements come up. After all, adding is generally easier than 
taking away existing things.
