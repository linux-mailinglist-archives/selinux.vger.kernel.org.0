Some history and a few observations. These are the common file
permissions as declared in the common access vector blocks in the
policy inherited by all the file classes and as defined as
COMMON_FILE_PERMS in security/selinux/include/classmap.h.
We used to have COMMON_FILE__READ, COMMON_FILE__WRITE, ... permission
definitions as well but those went away with the migration to dynamic
class/perm mapping and weren't being used in the code anyway; we have
always just used FILE__x in the code when it was a common file
permission. execmod was moved from being file-specific to being
duplicated for chr_file to being taken into the common file perms
(b424485abe2b16580a178b469917a7b6ee0c152a). open was moved to common
file perms and the explicit per-class mapping dropped from the code in
49b7b8de46d293113a0a0bb026ff7bd833c73367.

Before removing a permission from a class you need to ensure that the
check can never fire. It isn't enough that the operation might not be
implemented for the object; if the permission check can be reached
then we either need the permission to remain or replicate the check
against the object type before checking permission and return the same
error as the underlying code ala ENOTSUP or whatever.

Only options #2 and #4 ensure that the code won't compile if someone
removes a permission that is still being checked, so if we make a
change, I'd be inclined to do one of those two.
If we were to go with option 4, then the conditional should be based
on the security class stored in the inode security blob not based on
the mode bits.
