I see this as being different than SCTP. The AF_SMC support was
introduced with the extended_socket_class support which merely
introduced distinct socket security classes for each address family so
that SELinux can distinguish each address family in policy. Previously
a number of the socket address families were defaulting to the generic
socket security class and could not be distinguished in policy. The
only change was introducing a distinct security class specifically for
SMC sockets, not introducing any family/protocol-specific logic. Only
the socket layer access controls were being applied (both before and
after the introduction of the SMC socket class, just changing which
class was being used). Fixing the kernel to also map IPPROTO_SMC to
the SMC socket class likewise just ensure consistent application of
the socket layer access controls on SMC sockets regardless of how they
are created and doesn't introduce any SMC-specific logic.
