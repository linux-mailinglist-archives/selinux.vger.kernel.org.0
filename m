It would be nicer to simply have a single inode free hook, but it
doesn't look like that is a possibility due to the inode
synchronization methods and differing lifetimes of inodes and their
associated LSM state.  At least the workaround isn't too ugly :)

I'd prefer to keep the naming as-is in this patch since
security_inode_free() does trigger the free'ing/release of the LSM
state associated with the inode.

Done.  That did conflict with the parameter name so I renamed the
parameter everywhere to "inode_security".

Thanks, metadata added.  This was a quick RFC patch so I didn't want
to spend a lot of time chasing down metadata refs until I knew there
was some basic support for this approach.  I still want to make sure
it is okay with the IMA folks.

Yes, it's a bit complicated with the IMA/EVM promotion happening
fairly recently.  I'm marking the patch with a stable tag, but
considering we're at -rc7 and this needs at least one more respin,
testing, ACKs, etc. it might not land in Linus' tree until sometime
post v6.11-rc1.  Considering that, I might suggest dropping the
Landlock hook in -stable and re-adding it to Linus' tree once this fix
lands, but that decision is up to you.

Take a look at lsm_set_blob_sizes() and you'll see that the rcu_head
struct is already accounted for in the inode->i_security blob.

The unfortunate side effect of that is that the patch grows
significantly as everyone that touches inode->i_security would need to
be updated to use inode->i_security.data or something similar.  For a
patch that we likely want to see backported to -stable that could make
things more difficult than needed.

However, I have always thought we should add some better
structure/typing to these opaque LSM blobs both to get away from the
raw pointer math and add a marginal layer of safety.  I've envisioned
doing something like this:

  struct lsm_blob_inode {
    struct selinux_blob_inode selinux;
    struct smack_blob_inode smack;
    struct aa_blob_inode apparmor;
    ...
    struct rcu_head rcu;
  }

... with lsm_blob_inode allocated and assigned to inode->i_security.
Those LSMs that are enabled and require blob space would define their
struct with the necessary fields, those that were disabled or did not
require space would define an empty struct; some minor pre-processor
checking and header file work would be needed, but it shouldn't be too
bad.  Ideally, we would use the same approach for all of the LSM
security blobs, only with different LSM supplied structs.  Perhaps
once we land Casey's latest patchset I'll see about doing something
like that, but right now we've got bigger problems to address.

I'll hold off on posting a proper patch for this RFC until I hear back
from Mini or Roberto on the IMA changes.
