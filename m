Good point. I think I was tuning this formula back when I haven't
rebased this patch on top of the filename transition rework, so I
suspect that the filename_trans hash table was what was causing high
memory usage with plain roundup_pow_of_two()... With ~225k rules it
should be taking up ~2 MB in such case, which is quite a lot. (In
fact, even with the adjusted formula it would still allocate the same
table, so my crude method of measuring the memory usage apparently
wasn't reliable...) Now that this hash table is only at ~2500 elements
even with our imperfect policy, it should only take up ~32 KB when
rounding up, which is a pretty small overhead.

I'll re-test the patch with hashtab_compute_size() ~
roundup_pow_of_two(), this time logging the exact amount of bytes
taken up by the hash table arrays (which is the only thing that is
changing here). I expect it will show only a few 10s of KB difference,
in which case I'll respin the patch with this simpler (and likely a
bit faster) variant.
