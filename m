I'm also struggling a bit with the justification here. If the runtime
and memory usage is worse or no better in every dimension even with a
policy rewritten to use the new prefix/suffix matching feature, it
seems hard to justify the change.

I'd be curious to see what results you would get if you simply added
the new feature (prefix/suffix matching) without moving the name-based
transitions into the avtab.

Also wondering whether you considered the simpler approach of just
augmenting the kernel to recognize and support use of wildcards at the
beginning and/or end of the existing name field to signify a prefix or
suffix match. That seems more amenable to extensions beyond just
prefix or suffix match.
