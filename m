In Android, the use of Clang for building the kernel inhibits it, as
RANDSTRUCT support for Clang is still in development. The move to Clang
for AOSP kernels is motivated for enabling CFI [1] and other features
such as SCS [2]. AFAIK the move to Clang is already in effect for quite
awhile in the kernels running on Pixel devices.

About performance, the gcc RANDSTRUCT implementation also includes a
performance-preserving feature where randomization takes cacheline
boundary into consideration. The Clang implementation is expected to
have this as well. It's a valid concern and definitely garners testing
for anyone enabling the feature.
