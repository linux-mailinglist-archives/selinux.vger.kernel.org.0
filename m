Stephen, from re-reading your messages, I am not sure which option you
prefer at this stage. Are you leaning back towards -EPERM?

An alternative here would be -EOPNOTSUPP, this would be more explicit
for userland on the root cause. There are similar usages in hooks.c
(see selinux_lsm_getattr for instance).
