AppArmor too, I am working on revising the out of tree af_unix mediation

well at a minimum we shouldn't export the kernel internal LSM_ID if its
exposed to userspace it needs to be something that can live with for a
long time

- Fixed length strings, which really are just a long LSM ID, Say 8 bytes.
   Can still even look human readable. For most* LSMs this could just
   be their name.

   * only safesetid and capability don't fit atm

- and certainly uglier, for variable length use an index for one of the
   variable length strings, with an embedded \0 inside the variable length
   string

{
   size_t lsm_id_len;
   size_t lsm_id_ctx_index;
   size_t ctx_len;
   unsigned char ctx[];
}

with access to lsm id being ctx[lsm_id_ctx_index]
