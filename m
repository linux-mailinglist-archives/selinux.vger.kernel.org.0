The security_netif_sid() change looks fine to me.  I *think* that the
second netif label goes back to some of the original SELinux network
labeling, I believe the original intent may even predate my
involvement in the project but that is far enough back I can't say for
certain without doing some heavy mailing list searches :)

Is there a reason why you decided to use smp_{load,store} to guard
ocontext.sid[] as opposed to RCU/spinlock?  RCU would allow us to
avoid the memory barrier in smp_load_acquire() on every call to
ocontext_to_sid() and it looks like all of the non-exclusive callers
are already in a RCU protected section so the additional impact on an
already cached value should be next to nothing.  The spinlock would
make things slightly more complicated (take the lock, recheck
ocontext.sid, set/bail, unlock, etc.) but we are already in the slow
path at that point.
