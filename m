Agreed. Mapping the upper bits to the driver field would work. 

In this case, AVTAB_XPERMS_NLMSG proposed here would have the exact same
implementation as AVTAB_XPERMS_IOCTLFUNCTION. An option could be to rename the
AVTAB_XPERMS_IOCTLFUNCTION constant (for example, to AVTAB_XPERMS_PERMS, and
similarly moving AVTAB_XPERMS_IOCTLDRIVER to AVTAB_XPERMS_DRIVER). This is
describing more how struct avtab_extended_perms is being used rather than
focusing on its original meaning. (That is, the driver and perms fields are
historically related to ioctl, but they have their own meanings in the xperm
implementation).

The alternative is simply to have that new constant (AVTAB_XPERMS_NLMSG, maybe
renamed to AVTAB_XPERMS_NETLINK_MSGTYPE, to be more explicit?).

I can see how the resolution for cmd can be done, but I am not sure how the
family should be handled. I don't think it is ok to not correlate the family to
some data in the policy. Otherwise, it would be possible to reach a different
generic netlink family (with the same operation number of an operation granted
for a generic family in the policy). This means we should at least match on the
family name, but I doubt we can use the current struct avtab_extended_perms for
that.

For now, an option is to fallback to regular permission checks (avc_has_perm)
if the class is NETLINK_GENERIC. (This would mean that we don't make a call now
on how NETLINK_GENERIC should be handled, and keep the options open for a
decision in the future). In this case, an error would be raised if trying to
load a policy with extended permissions for that class (as nlmsg_type has no
static meaning).
