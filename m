If one has files on multiple partitions, using systemd for this would
require keeping all the filesystems mounted across the pivot,
something we're trying very hard to avoid because it makes the bootup
process (and potentially mount hierarchy) different between the first
and subsequent boots. See more discussions about this in:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/11903

But also, asking systemd to relabel the whole system on boot isn't...
ideal. In the filesystem provisioning case I mentioned, we would be
extracting files from an OSTree repo, which already has labeling
information.

I think the functionality on its own can be useful for a subset of use
cases. E.g. dracut modules which need to write some files outside of
/run (since that one already gets relabeled automatically)?

If only relabeling a few files, we can use the libselinux APIs
(`selabel_*`), fetching the file context policy from /sysroot. In the
"full filesystem reprovision" scenario, labeling information is
already part of the objects we're writing.

One might then ask, "why not just load the policy in the initrd
instead?". The answer is that this also comes with a host of issues,
and isn't very widely used in practice. See discussions about that in:

https://github.com/coreos/ignition/issues/635
