libsepol does not make any assumptions about policy. Everything is
defined in the policy mls or mcs files in terms of constraints.

Files are, by definition, single level objects because they cannot be
decomposed. A file with U - TS data in it is a TS file.

The policy (not libsepol) handles enforcing single-level objects, for
example in refpolicy:

# make sure these file classes are "single level"
mlsconstrain { file lnk_file fifo_file } { create relabelto }
        ( l2 eq h2 );

You cannot create or relabel a file with anything other than low = high.

Directories can be ranged, if they contain files of multiple levels,
again, from refpolicy:
# Directory "write" ops
mlsconstrain dir { add_name remove_name reparent rmdir }
        (( l1 eq l2 ) or
         (( t1 == mlsfilewriteinrange ) and ( l1 dom l2 ) and ( l1
domby h2 )) or
         (( t1 == mlsfilewritetoclr ) and ( h1 dom l2 ) and ( l1 domby l2 )) or
         ( t1 == mlsfilewrite ) or
         ( t2 == mlstrustedobject ));

So the source low must equal the directory low or one of the mls
exception attributes controls fine grained usage.

libsepol isn't really doing anything here. You can use semanage to set
a file context, something like:

# semanage fcontext -r s0-s0:c0.c3 /home/username
# restorecon -R /home/username

But you do need to be careful of escalation as you've noted, you may
need a number of these to set specific files to the user high level
