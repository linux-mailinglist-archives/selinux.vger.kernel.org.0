+# Contributing to SELinux
+
+Contributing to the SELinux userspace project is a similar process to
+other open source projects. Bug reports, new features to the existing
+code, additional tools, or updated documentation are all welcome.
+
+You can find a list of open issues where you might contribute to the SELinux kernel code at
+https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel/issues or to the SELinux userspace code at
+https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/issues.
+
+See the selinuxproject.org http://selinuxproject.org/page/User_Resources page for more
+information on mailing lists, documentation, and other resources.
+
+## Reporting Bugs
+
+All bugs and patches should be submitted to the SELinux mailing
+list at selinux@vger.kernel.org - https://lore.kernel.org/selinux .
+
+When reporting bugs please include versions of SELinux related libraries and
+tools (libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage, checkpolicy). If you are
+using a custom policy please include it as well.
+
+## Compiling
+
+There are a number of dependencies required to build the userspace
+tools/libraries. On a Fedora system you can install them with yum:
+
+    # yum install audit-libs-devel bison bzip2-devel dbus-devel dbus-glib-devel flex flex-devel flex-static glib2-devel libcap-devel libcap-ng-devel pam-devel pcre-devel python3-devel python3-setools swig xmlto redhat-rpm-config
+
+
+The tools and libraries can be built and installed under a private directory from the top level with make, e.g.
+
+    $ make DESTDIR=~/obj install install-pywrap
+
+## Contributing Code
+
+After obtaining the code of the repository (see below), create a patch
+against the repository, and post that patch to the SELinux mailing
+list at selinux@vger.kernel.org - https://lore.kernel.org/selinux .
+When preparing patches, please follow these guidelines:
+
+-   Patches should apply with -p1
+-   Must apply against HEAD of the master branch
+-   Separate large patches into logical patches
+-   Patch descriptions must end with your "Signed-off-by" line.
+    This means your code meets the Developer's certificate of origin -
+    https://developercertificate.org/.
+
+When adding new, large features or tools it is best to discuss the
+design on the mailing list prior to submitting the patch.
+
+## Development Repository
+
+Git is a modern source code management system. For more information
+about Git please see the Git website.
+
+To get an anonymous checkout of the SELinux userland repository you can
+run:
+
+    $ git clone <https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux
