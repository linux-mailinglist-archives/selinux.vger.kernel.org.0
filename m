How to deny mprotect()? struct file_operations does not have callback
for that (AFAIK).

What if instead simply:

- Require to do PROT_NONE mmap() for the ELRANGE before ECREATE.
- Disallow mprotect() up until EINIT.
- Given that we have a callback for mprotect() check that permissions
  match EADD'd permissions.
