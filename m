I must say I'm a little concerned about switching to GFP_ATOMIC here.
The sidtab table can become quite large on long-running systems (since
it's grow-only currently) and in such case the kernel could have a
hard time allocating everything atomically. Maybe we could instead
pass the fsi->mutex's lockdep_map to security_load_policy() and call
lockdep_is_held() inside as a sanity check? This would document that
the function is expected to be called in mutual exclusion and also
detect at runtime if someone accidentally moves the call outside of
the mutex's critical section. It's not perfect, since a careless
programmer can still abuse it, but at least the lockdep_map argument
would warn anyone calling that function (or reviewing a related patch)
that there is some locking constraint that needs to be respected.

Otherwise the patch looks good to me after a brief look.
