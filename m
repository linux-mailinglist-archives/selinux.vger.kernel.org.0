Subject: [PATCH] selinux: ensure we cleanup the internal AVC counters on =
error
 in avc_update()

In AVC update we don't call avc_node_kill() when avc_xperms_populate()
fails, resulting in the avc->avc_cache.active_nodes counter having a
false value. In last patch this changes was missed , so correcting it.
