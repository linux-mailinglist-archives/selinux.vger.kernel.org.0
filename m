I did not understand the part about using "cat build/test-suite.log",
but otherwise the idea of putting the commands into a dedicated script
file sounds good, as this allows more flexibility. In order to know
which command failed (and fail as soon as a command fails), I suggest
using "set -e -x" in these scripts.

By the way, about the issue with "make", there is another thing from
your initial message that I understood only after sending my first
reply: a consequence of using "make -k" that can be considered
undesirable is the fact that when an error happens, its message can be
drowned among the flow of other messages. I disagree with removing
"-k" because this would only show one error, instead of all the errors
that occur during a build. Nevertheless it is possible to achieve the
best of both alternatives by using constructions such as:

if ! make install $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS -k ; then
  echo >&2 "Error in make install $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS:"
  make install $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS   # This command shows one error,
at the end of the build logs.
  exit 1
fi

Would such constructions be helpful?

Cheers,
Nicolas
