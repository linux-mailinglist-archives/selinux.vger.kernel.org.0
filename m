That would be a hash of the policy file that was last loaded via the 
selinuxfs interface for loading policy, not a hash of the in-memory 
policy data structures at the time of measurement (which is what this 
patch series is implementing).  The duplicative part is with respect to 
selecting a hash algorithm and hashing the in-memory policy as part of 
the SELinux code rather than just passing the policy buffer to IMA for 
measurement like any other buffer.  Userspace can already hash the 
in-memory policy data itself by running sha256sum or whatever on 
/sys/fs/selinux/policy, so we don't need to save or expose that separately.
