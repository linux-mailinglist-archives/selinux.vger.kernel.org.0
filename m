Or ERESTARTSYS if you want to select the behavior from caller using
SA_RESTART, whether to restart or -EINTR.

Yeah, I'd go for this simply because it allows better reviewer

I don't want to dictate this because might give wrong advice (given
bandwidth to think it through). Pick a solution and we'll look at it :-)
