Thanks Ondrej, this looks pretty good to me.  There is some minor
nitpicky stuff below, but those comments are mainly FYIs for future
reference.  Given where we are at in the -rcX cycle, I am going to
hold off on merging this until after the upcoming merge window.

Style nit, I don't like placing trailing comments on the same line as
code.  Don't respin this patch just for this, but remember this for
future submissions.

This is another "please don't respin for this", but if you have to
respin for any reason can you change the variable name to
"isid_init_supported" or something similar?  The "secsid" portion of
the name looks wrong to me.
