My apologies if I was on that thread, but can you remind me why it was
a problem?  Why can't we use a single tracepoint to capture the AVC
information?

It may not be unique to SELinux, but that doesn't mean I like it :)

One of my concerns with adding tracepoints is that the code would get
littered with tracepoints; I accepted that it the AVC decision
codepath was an obvious place for one, so we added a tracepoint.
Having two tracepoints here is getting awfully close to my original
fears.

Wait, why would you be adding a trace event to a trace event, or am I
misunderstanding you?

All I was talking about was adding the permission resolution code to
the already existing SELinux AVC tracepoint.
