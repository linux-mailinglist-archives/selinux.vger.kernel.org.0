Sigh... okay, I now did test the scenario with a FreeBSD system as B

I'm not saying the concern is not credible or that (in general)
testing this use case is not important. What I'm missing is some
explanation/reasoning that would make me think "Oh yeah, these patches
really could break this scenario". You said something about consistent
IP header overhead and bidirectional stream-based connections, but I
don't understand how the former could cause an issue with the latter.
Does it violate some specification? And I'm not arguing that there
isn't a possible bug because I don't see it; I'm just arguing that if
there is a mechanism through which the change could cause a bug in
this scenario, you should be able to explain it (at least roughly) to
someone who doesn't see it there.

Paul, I don't want to break the kernel, but that doesn't mean I will
do an excessive amount of work for someone else when there doesn't
seem to be a logical reason to do so. IMHO, just because someone
somewhere has a special hard-to-test use case that is very important
to them doesn't mean that it is your job as a community project
maintainer to force other contributors to do work to defend these
peoples' use cases. The fact that we don't see any effort from them to
have their use case tested upstream (they could either auto-run their
tests on patches themselves and mail back the results or provide the
test code and/or infrastructure and ask maintainers + contributors to
run the tests on patches before they are merged) means that one of the
following is true:
1. They do care about upstream not breaking their use case, but expect
that upstream will automatically ensure that "for free".
2. They accept the fact that upstream may break their use case and
they rely on testing at a later stage to find issues and
reporting/fixing the bugs once they are found. Usually this is because
they have calculated / assume that at the given time, the cost of
implementing/facilitating testing on upstream level is higher than the
cost of finding the bugs later and waiting for the upstream kernel to
become usable again.
In both cases it doesn't make sense for the community to self-impose
the need to substitute the lack of effort from the consumer side, and
much less so to push that effort to others (which will just drive
contributors away, which is a far worse consequence than possibly
breaking some complex scenario once in a while). However, as soon as
someone comes and says "Hey, we have this test, this is how you can
run it. Can you make sure patches touching X are tested with it? If
it's too much of a hassle, let us help to make it work.", it's an
entirely different situation and we (both contributors and
maintainers) should very much do our best to fulfill the request.

This is my idea of how the fine balance in the
user-maintainer-contributor relationship could work best. I'm writing
it here so that you can understand where I'm coming from and perhaps
ponder about it a bit. But the main point here is that you requested a
complicated scenario to be tested without adequately explaining what
you assume to be possibly broken. And I also pointed out that the
behavior you seem to think can cause breakage is already present in
the current code - you didn't answer that. So I feel like you
arbitrarily push some high-effort requirement on me and that's not
nice.
