Instead of just "NetLabel" here we should probably give some
indication that this is NetLabel with the static/fallback "protocol".

I wonder if it is even worth mentioning compat_net here, without any
explanation of the controls it just seems confusing.

2.6.30 was released over 11 years ago.

Similar to my comments above, there should be some indication of
NetLabel here, e.g. "NetLabel/CIPSO"; I fear this will be confusing
otherwise.

It may be more accurate to say that the SELinux network access
controls are not enforced by default; they must first be configured or
forced on by the "always_check_network" policy capability.

It seems like it might be better to move this explanation closer to
the top of this section.
