 # SELinux Networking Support
 
-SELinux supports the following types of network labeling:
+SELinux controls network access in the kernel at two locations: at the
+socket interface, and when packets are processed by the protocol
+stacks. Controls at the socket interface are invoked when a task makes
+network related system calls and thus the access permission checks
+mimic the sockets programming interface (e.g. ***bind**(2)*
+vs. `node_bind`). Packet controls are more distant from applications
+and they are invoked whenever any packets are received, forwarded or
+sent.
+
+Packet level controls include:
+
+* Packet labeling with SECMARK: class `packet`
+* Peer labeling with Labeled IPSec or NetLabel: class `peer`
+* Interface control: class `netif`
+* Network node control: class `node`
+
+Controls at socket interface include:
+
+* TCP/UDP/SCTP/DCCP ports: class `port`
+
+SECMARK is a security extension in Linux network packet processing,
+which allows packets or sessions to be marked with security labels.
+
+NetLabel is a framework for explicit network labeling that abstracts
+away the underlying labeling protocol from the LSMs. Labeled IPsec and
+the NetLabel framework are the current access controls for class
+`peer`, with NetLabel supporting CIPSO for IPv4, CALIPSO for IPv6, and
+a fallback/static labeling for unlabeled IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
+
+Packet controls can be organized further according to the source of
+the label for the packets, which can be internal or external:
 
 **Internal labeling** - This is where network objects are labeled and
 managed internally within a single machine (i.e. their labels are not
 transmitted as part of the session with remote systems). There are two
-types supported: SECMARK and NetLabel. There was a service known as
-'compat_net' controls, however that was removed in kernel 2.6.30.
-
-**Labeled Networking** - This is where labels are passed to/from remote
-systems where they can be interpreted and a MAC policy enforced on each
-system. There are three types supported: Labeled IPSec, CIPSO
-(Commercial IP Security Option) and CALIPSO (Common Architecture Label

-
-There are two policy capability options that can be set within policy
+types supported: SECMARK and NetLabel with the static/fallback
+"protocol". As an example, SECMARK access controls could restrict
+`firefox_t` to talking only to network services on TCP port 80 while
+NetLabel fallback/static rules could restrict `firefox_t` to only
+receive data from specific IP addresses on a specific network
+interface.
+
+**Labeled Networking** - This is where labels are passed to/from
+remote systems where they can be interpreted and a MAC policy enforced
+on each system. There are three types supported: Labeled IPSec,
+NetLabel/CIPSO (Commercial IP Security Option) and NetLabel/CALIPSO
+(Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option). With labeled
+networking, it's possible to compare the security attributes (SELinux
+label) of the sending peer with the security context of the receiving
+peer. A simple example with Labeled IPSec is restricting `firefox_t`
+to talking only to `httpd_t`, while NetLabel/CIPSO & CALIPSO could
+restrict domains with MLS security level `s32` not to talk with
+domains with level `s31`.
+
+SELinux network access controls are not enabled by default. They can
+be enabled by configuring SECMARK, NetLabel or Labeled IPsec rules, or
+forced on with the policy capability ***always_check_network***.

+## Packet controls: Access Control for Network Interfaces
+
+SELinux domains can be restricted to use only specific network
+interfaces. TE rules must define the interface types and then allow a
+domain to `egress` in class `netif` for the defined interface types:
+
+```
+require {
+        attribute netif_type;
+		class netif { egress ingress };
+}
+
+type external_if_t, netif_type;
+type loopback_if_t, netif_type;
+
+allow my_server_t external_if_t:netif egress;
+allow my_server_t loopback_if_t:netif egress;
+```
+
+The interfaces must also be labeled with ***semanage**(8)* (or by
+using `netifcon` statements in the policy):
+```
+semanage interface -a -t loopback_if_t -r s0 lo
+semanage interface -a -t external_if_t -r s0 eth0
+```
+
+The checks for `ingress` in class `netif` however use the peer label
+of the remote peer (not the receiving task on the local system) as
+subject:
+
+```
+type internet_peer_t;
+
+allow internet_peer_t external_if_t:netif ingress;
+```
+
+The peers must also be labeled with various methods provided by
+***netlabelctl**(8)*. A simple example with fallback/static labeling is:
+
+```
+netlabelctl unlbl add default address:2000::/3 label:system_u:object_r:internet_peer_t:s0
+```
+
+## Packet controls: Access Control for Network Nodes
+
+Domains can be restricted by SELinux to access and bind sockets to
+only dedicated network nodes (in practice, IP addresses).
+
+The node types must be defined and then the node types can be used for
+TE rules as target context. TE rules to allow a domain to `sendto` for
+class `node` and to `node_bind` (for incoming connections) for class
+`tcp_socket`:
+
+```
+require {
+        attribute node_type;
+		class node { sendto recvfrom };
+		class tcp_socket node_bind;
+}
+
+type loopback_node_t, node_type;
+type internet_node_t, node_type;
+type link_local_node_t, node_type;
+type multicast_node_t, node_type;
+
+allow my_server_t loopback_node_t:node sendto;
+allow my_server_t loopback_node_t:tcp_socket node_bind;
+allow my_server_t internet_node_t:node sendto;
+```
+
+After the types have been defined, corresponding node rules can be
+added with `semanage` (or `nodecon` statements):
+```
+semanage node -a -M /128 -p ipv6 -t loopback_node_t -r s0 ::1
+semanage node -a -M /3 -p ipv6 -t internet_node_t -r s0 2000::
+semanage node -a -M /8 -p ipv6 -t link_local_node_t -r s0 fe00::
+semanage node -a -M /8 -p ipv6 -t multicast_node_t -r s0 ff00::
+```
+
+The checks for `recvfrom` in class `node` however use the peer label
+as subject:
+
+```
+allow internet_peer_t internet_node_t:node { recvfrom sendto };
+```
+
+## Socket controls: Access Control for Network Ports
+
+SELinux policy can also control access to ports used by various
+networking protocols such as TCP, UDP, SCTP and DCCP. In contrast to
+packet level controls, port controls are close to how networked
+applications use the socket system calls. Thus the controls typically
+involve checking if a task can perform an operation on a network
+socket, e.g. ***bind**(2)* would cause an access check for
+`node_bind`. These are usually easy to understand and don't require
+any special network configuration.
+
+TE rules must define the port types and then allow a domain to
+`name_connect` (outgoing) or `name_bind` (incoming) in class
+`tcp_socket` (or `udp_socket` etc) for the defined port types:
+
+```
+require {
+        attribute port_type;
+		class tcp_socket { name_bind name_connect };
+}
+
+type my_server_port_t, port_type;
+
+allow my_server_t my_server_port_t:tcp_socket name_connect;
+allow my_server_t my_server_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;
+```
+
+The ports must also be labeled with `semanage` (or `portcon`
+statements):
+```
+semanage port -a -t my_server_port_t -p tcp -r s0 12345
+```
