Thank you for asking these questions. I think that if we
can address the issues around dbus we'll be in pretty good
shape in general.

I don't see how to do that without making the Fedora and Ubuntu user spac=

Good, that's how it looks to me as well.

/sys/kernel/security/lsm provides the list of all LSMs active on the syst=

It would be trivial to add /sys/kernel/security/default-display-lsm which=

Stephen Smalley has already pointed out some of these issues.
I see display being used in scripts:

	echo apparmor > /proc/self/attr/display
	apparmor-do-stuff --options --deamon

much more than inside new or updated programs.

Yes, because so much of the user-space ecosystem depends on programs
that rarely get updated there has to be a way to specify it externally.
I don't like the situation, but we can't ignore it.

My hope is that new and updated programs will have to tools
they need to get it right, and that those that don't won't
fall over on a well configured system.

/proc/<pid>/attr/current_stack is easy. SO_PEERSECLABELS will be
harder to sell, but would not be hard to implement if we can get
agreement on the Hideous format.

In addition, yes. Instead of? I don't think that we can have a
backward compatibility story that flies without it.

I think that's necessary.
