Okay, so I guess you addressed your comments more towards refpolicy
maintainer/contributors than to me as the submitter/testsuite
maintainer and I didn't have to react so defensively...

I agree that having better semantic interfaces for RDMA users in
refpolicy and Fedora policy would be nice, but I also wouldn't block
having a working testsuite on that. I'll be happy to switch any new
appropriate interfaces (and replicate them in Fedora policy) once they
are available.
