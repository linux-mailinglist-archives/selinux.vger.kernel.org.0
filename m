A few notes for anyone trying to run this on Debian:

1) There is an open bug in Debian around gdm login shells running in
the wrong context (initrc_t instead of unconfined_t),
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=874191, due to the
/sys/fs/selinux/user ERANGE problem breaking pam_selinux for the
systemd --user instance and the lack of either a policy workaround (as
previously done in Fedora to limit outbound transitions from init_t to
only valid cases) or the recent libselinux fix (to stop using
/sys/fs/selinux/user altogether).  To permit testing without requiring
my own custom policy or libselinux, I simply ran the tests from a ssh
login rather than a graphical login.  Non-graphical console login
probably would have worked too but I didn't try. But I have escalated
the bug with the Debian SELinux maintainers in hopes of getting that
fixed.

2) In Debian unstable, I also had to setsebool -P ssh_sysadm_login=1
to allow ssh login as unconfined.  I let the Debian SELinux
maintainers know but it isn't clear they will change the default.

3) Debian policy package ships with /etc/selinux/config set to
permissive since the policy often doesn't work cleanly out of the box,
so I had to manually setenforce 1 before running the testsuite.  This
btw killed any gdm login sessions as well due to missing execmem and
other permissions so that's another reason to not do it from a gdm
login under their current policy.

4) The Debian stable kernel didn't enable CONFIG_NETLABEL so all of
the netlabel-dependent inet_socket tests failed on stable.  Debian
unstable kernel had CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled and they all passed there.
I didn't consider it worthwhile to build my own Debian stable kernel
for testing it; I just wanted to ensure that the policy worked, which
I consider the Debian unstable test to prove.

Interestingly, on Debian unstable, we end up running more tests than
on Fedora rawhide currently: 64 test scripts with 869 individual tests
versus 62 test scripts with 824 individual tests.  This is because
Debian unstable's policy (which is based on a recent snapshot of
refpolicy) has class and permission definitions for everything in its
kernel except the lockdown class, versus Fedora which lacks the watch*
permissions as well as the perf_event and lockdown classes.
