Unless there was a compelling reason for basing it on the SELinux
branch, I asked that you base the changes on v5.10.0-rc1 (or later),
which has nothing to do with the SELinux branch.  Once this patch set
is reviewed and ready to be upstreamed, a topic branch will be created
containing at least the IMA patches.   The decision as to how the the
SELinux patch will be upstreamed will be made at that point.  That
discussion will be between Paul and me.

thanks,

Mimi
