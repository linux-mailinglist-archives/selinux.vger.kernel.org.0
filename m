This issue will also, in some cases, cause selinux-autorelabel to fail.


systemd can't compute the contexts for socket activated daemons, and so
these daemons fail to start. device mapper seems to be one of them, and
so partitions might not get mounted in the autorelabel target
effectively that means that autorelabel wont be able to relabel
everything (because its not mounted because device-mapper failed to
start, because systemd was unable to compute.
