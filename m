It does make sense, but I'm not sure it's correct to assume that any
LSM policy will always allow execution on enclave source pages if it
would allow execution inside the enclave.  As an example, here is a
policy that seems reasonable:

Task A cannot execute dynamic non-enclave code (no execmod, no
execmem, etc -- only approved unmodified file pages can be executed).
But task A can execute an enclave with MRENCLAVE =3D=3D such-and-such, and
that enclave may be loaded from regular anonymous memory -- the
MRENCLAVE is considered enough verification.

selinux_enclave_load() calling selinux_file_mprotect() in my code. The purp=

ually granting X.

As above, I'm not convinced this assumption is valid.
