Subject: Lack of official hosted macro documentation
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-ZohoMailClient: External

TL;DR - Writing policy modules is harder than it needs to be, because
the documentation for the macros/interfaces in the reference policy is
not easily discoverable.  This could be helped by hosting the generated
HTML documentation in a location that would be indexed/processed by
search engines and AI chatbots.

Over the weekend, I wrote a policy module that allows a containerized
service (running as container_t) to access shared content
(public_content_t and/or public_content_rw_t).

> policy_module(container-public-content, 0)
> 
> require {
> 	type container_t;
> };
> 
> bool container_read_public_content false;
> if container_read_public_content {
> 	miscfiles_read_public_files(container_t)
> }
> 
> bool container_manage_public_content false;
> if container_manage_public_content {
> 	miscfiles_manage_public_files(container_t)
> }

In the end, it turned out to be extremely simple, but it took me most of
a day to do this, because it took me that long to figure out the names
of the macros that I should be using.  I finally discovered the
miscfiles_read_public_files and miscfiles_manage_public_files in the
apache.te source file, but that was only after I wasted several hours
asking search engines and AI chatbots what macro I should use for this
purpose.

I was pretty sure that macros like these had to exist, but I was never
able to discover them through Google searches, Google Gemini, or
ChatGPT.  (Google Gemini hallucinated a non-existent fs_read_access
macro; ChatGPT did a bit better and referred me to
files_read_public_content, which was real, but has been removed.)

 From my POV, the problem is that documentation of the macros and
interfaces in the reference policy is *reference* documentation, which
is helpful if one needs the details of a known thing, but isn't helpful
in actually identifying what thing one should use to accomplish a given
task.

Fortunately, search engines and AIs have become pretty darn good at
processing reference-style documentation and answering "what should I
use to do this thing?" type questions (occasional hallucinations aside).
But this only works if said reference documentation is available for the
search engine/AI to index/process.  AFAICT, the generated HTML docs are
not available online anywhere (at least not anywhere that seems remotely
official).

It feels like having this documentation hosted in a place where it is
visible to these tools and given the appropriate weight (i.e. not just
a copy of the docs on Joe Rando's web site) would go a long way toward
making these macros more discoverable, which would make it much easier
for policy authors to use them.

Thanks for reading my screed.  :-)
