I agree with others. Your proposal sounds too radical and doesn't seem
necessary to me. I'd like to see the traces and understand how
real/frequent the issue is.

We haven't seen any such cases so far. But due to some other reasons,
we are seriously considering temporarily increasing the GC-thread's
priority when it is running stop-the-world pause.

There are userspace solutions possible to reduce/eliminate the number
of times userfaultfd register/unregister are done during a GC. I
didn't do it due to added complexity it would introduce to the GC's
code.

In every GC invocation, we have two userfaultfd_register() + mremap()
in a stop-the-world pause, and then two userfaultfd_unregister() at
the end of GC. The problematic ones ought to be the one in the pause
as we want to keep it as short as possible. The reason we want to
register/unregister the heap during GC is so that the overhead of
userfaults can be avoided when GC is not active.

That shouldn't be the case. The access to uffd registered VMAs should
start *after* registration. That's the reason it is done in a pause.
AFAIK, the source of contention is if some native (non-java) thread,
which is not participating in the pause, does a mmap_lock write
operation (mmap/munmap/mprotect/mremap/mlock etc.) elsewhere in the
address space. The heap can't be involved.
