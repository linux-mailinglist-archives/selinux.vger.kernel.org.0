There is a third option, that's actually to revert only the autofs
change and forgo the couple of extra checks we get from kern_write().

My recommendation of keeping the change and documenting the behaviour
via security policy includes the implicit assumption that there are
no other cases of this.

If that wasn't the case then changing the kernel functions or (likely
better option of) simply using __kern_write() in those cases would be
the better choice IMHO.
