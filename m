If you are running AppArmor on the host system and SELinux in a
container you are likely going to have some *very* bizarre behavior as
the SELinux policy you load in the container will apply to the entire
system, including processes which started *before* the SELinux policy
was loaded.  While I understand the point you are trying to make, I
don't believe the example you chose is going to work without a lot of
other changes.

Regardless of the above example, I want to be clear that I'm not
suggesting changes to the /proc interfaces.  Existing LSM aware
applications that use procfs for information would continue to work as
expected, it would just be the simul-multi-LSM aware applications that
would need to transition to the new syscall API to get all of the LSM
labels.

Why is it a forgone conclusion that a library would be necessary for
basic operations?  If the kernel/userspace API is sane to begin with
we could probably either significantly reduce or eliminate the need
for additional libraries.  I really want us to attempt to come up with
a decent kernel/userspace API to begin with as opposed to using the
excuse of a userspace library to hide API sins that never should have
been committed.

The LSM stacking work presents us with a unique opportunity to
modify/update/whatever the LSM kernel/userspace API, I don't want to
see us squander this chance on a hack.

True.  However I don't see that as a blocker, trivial helper
applications can be written for those who wish to incorporate the new
syscall-based API into their scripts.  We would not be the first (or
the last) in this regard.

Once again, I'm not talking about removing the existing procfs
interface; existing applications would continue to work.  Only
applications which wanted to be simul-multi-LSM aware would need to be
modified, and those applications would need to be modified regardless
of if the procfs or syscall-based API was used.

They obviously would Casey, not only is that the context of the
discussion but my dummy example clearly had support for multiple LSMs.

They are now, they are also a bit of a mess with legacy constraints
and they only get more complicated and messy with the LSM stacking
patches.  It is my opinion that a syscall-based API is cleaner and
easier for applications to use.

Yes, that's why I didn't bring up audit as it doesn't weigh on this
decision.  If you really want to include audit for some reason, I'll
simply remind you that I pushed back hard on overloading the existing
subj/obj fields with a multiplexed label format, asking for individual
subj/obj fields for each LSM.

I'm not talking about kernel internal data structures Casey, I'm
talking about the kernel/userspace API.

Perhaps a liblsm library would be useful for other reasons beyond this
discussion, but I don't want to use a userspace library as an excuse
to support an awful kernel/userspace API.

I've never liked the combined label interfaces, see the mention of
audit in this email above.  I'm sure if you wanted to dig through all
of the mail archives I'm sure I've probably mentioned my dislike of
the combined label interface in procfs too; if not on the mailing list
then surely in-person at some point.  However, regardless of all that,
the key difference is that prior to a few months ago I didn't have to
worry about it quite as much as I do now.  Now I'm responsible for
standing up for the code that goes into the LSM tree and that means
both defending it as "good" and maintaining it long term; prior to a
few months ago that was, politely, "not my problem" :)

I can't currently in good conscience defend the kernel/userspace
combined label interfaces as "good", especially when we have a very
rare opportunity to do better.
