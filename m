Practically yes name-based type transitions but other than that it makes th=
e experience much simpler if you have just one unconfined system domain.
I actually kind of got that idea from you when you mentioned the three doma=
in model.

It works reasonably nicely with exception of this pam_selinux issue.

Its also used by pam_selinux env_params (which in turn is used by ssh for "=
ssh user/role/level@host")
The problem is that the default_type for ssh and sudo sessions may differ (=
ie. default_type is not really a default_type)

Ex. joe's default type for sudo might be joe_r:joe_t, but for ssh it might =
be joe_r:joe_ssh_t

We hit that same isssue when we revisted mdp a while ago. Removing the env_=
params was a quick fix for that then.
