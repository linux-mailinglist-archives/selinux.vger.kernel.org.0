I talk to Karl MacMillian offline and he too is of the opinion that
the socket should be created with the target applications context. I'm
going to submit a feature request to systemd for the removal of the
special case of using systemds context when the SELinuxContextFromNet
option is set in .socket file. Thanks everyone for your input.
