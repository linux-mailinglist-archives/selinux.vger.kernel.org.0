I should note however that we largely moved away from that model for
the successors to DTMach/DTOS, splitting out separate class/permission
definitions and responsibility to the individual object managers.
Checking the "service" permissions in the auto-generated IPC wrappers
or subsystem has its own set of limitations, e.g. the object manager
will not yet have looked up and potentially locked the underlying
object in question.
