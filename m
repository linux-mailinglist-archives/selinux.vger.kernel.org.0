I considered calling it policy_mutex but wasn't sure it was
necessary/worthwhile and also thought it might be confusing (obvious
question becomes why isn't that mutex part of struct selinux_policy,
but that's a layering thing).  I'll wait to see what name Paul prefers
before spinning another patch.

I'm using the emacs mode settings from
Documentation/process/codingstyle.rst.  I don't see anything in the
coding style document to suggest use of extra spaces for aligned
argument lists; if anything use of spaces rather than tabs for
indentation seems discouraged.  I don't really care either way but
would like editor settings to ensure consistency.
