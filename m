Thanks, I'll prepare another patchset with improved commit messages.

In the mean time I'm looking into removing deprecated symbols from libsepol=
 as it's
supposed to be required only by selinux components. So far I've found that
deprecated sepol_check_context() is used in chkcon utility. As Fedora doesn=
't ship
this tool I incline to remove it from libsepol as well.

And there's also

/* Deprecated */
struct sepol_handle sepol_compat_handle =3D {
=09.msg_callback =3D sepol_msg_default_handler,
=09.msg_callback_arg =3D NULL,
};

void sepol_debug(int on)
{
=09sepol_compat_handle.msg_callback =3D (on) ?
=09    sepol_msg_default_handler : NULL;
}

/* End deprecated */

which is used on few places internally.


Later I'll check whether sssd uses any on deprecated libsemanage symbol and
decide what to do.
