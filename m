Up-thread I thought Linus indicated he didn't really want a flag to
disable pemission checking due to potential abuse (and I agree).
Historically we have taken one of two approaches for these situations:
1) Provide a separate interface like kernel_write() for use when we
don't want permission checking and don't have it call the security
hook at all.  If you prefer kernel_write_nosec() that's fine but I
think that's somewhat implicit in the fact that it is a
kernel-initiated write, not a userspace write (which would hopefully
go through vfs_write() or similar and end up calling the hook).
2) Temporarily override creds to the init_cred or the result of
prepare_kernel_creds() before calling any credential-checking
functions and then revert creds afterward.

The problem with #2 is that it still requires that the policy allow
kernel_t (or its equivalent) to be able to write to these pipes, which
wasn't previously necessary and thus might not be allowed in all
policies (e.g. Android?).  #1 avoids any need for policy for these
operations.
