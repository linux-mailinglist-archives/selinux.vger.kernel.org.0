I'm also considering whether to drop the two patches that were
externally contributed.
The one from James to mark init_selinux_state/ns as ro_after_init
seems kind of pointless; it isn't really used after init except for a
check in the runtime disable code so I don't see any gain from making
it read-only.  The one from Peter to introduce a lockdep class for
what used to be the services (security server) locks is partly
obsoleted by the elimination of the policy rwlock and the description
no longer fits since the status lock got moved up earlier from the
selinux_ss to the selinux_state.
