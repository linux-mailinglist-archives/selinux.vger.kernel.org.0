Yes, I see what you mean.  I'm getting AVC violations because sshd 
isn't supposed to perform getattr and setopt actions on a tcp_socket of 
type unconfined_service_t, which is what it gets when it inherits a 
socket from tcpserver instead of opening the socket itself.

It looks like the tcp_socket needs to undergo a type transition along
with the process.  Is there any way to express this?

PS: There appears to be a bunch of redundant rules relating sshd_t and 
tcp_socket in the system's policy database.  Part of the output from 
sesearch says:

allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { accept append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl listen lock read setattr setopt shutdown write };
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { accept append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl listen lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ nis_enabled ]:True
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { accept append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl listen lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ nis_enabled ]:True
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap ]:True
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ kerberos_enabled ]:True
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ kerberos_enabled ]:True
allow sshd_t sshd_t:tcp_socket { append bind connect create getattr getopt ioctl lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ kerberos_enabled ]:True
allow sshd_t tcpd_t:tcp_socket { append bind connect getattr getopt ioctl lock read setattr setopt shutdown write }; [ ssh_use_tcpd ]:True

Don't all those boolean-controlled rules just allow things that are
already allowed anyway?  Or do they override the first rule, forbidding
some of the things it allows (which seems contrary to the idea of using
these booleans to allow things that wouldn't normally be allowed)?

PPS: Is there any document anywhere that explains all the details
needed to understand and create selinux policies?  I see individual
items covered piecemeal in the wiki pages at selinuxproject.org, but no
organized whole.  Certainly nothing that would enable the reader to
formulate a strategy for solving the problem I encountered.

As just one example, is there a complete listing of the syntax
required/accepted by checkmodule in a .te file?
