Hello,
I did not really follow closely why functions are getting deprecated.
>From the patch series, it appears that matchpathcon_init() is being
deprecated in favor of selabel_open(). That can make sense.

>From a CLI perspective, the interface of selabel_lookup seems to be
more complex to use that matchpathcon:

$ matchpathcon /etc/shadow
/etc/shadow system_u:object_r:shadow_t
$ selabel_lookup -b file -k /etc/shadow
Default context: system_u:object_r:shadow_t

Moreover, looking at selabel_lookup --help, it was not clear that the
file for which I wanted the context needs to be given as a -k option,
because the usage line states "[-f file]" (that means something else).
This increases the difficulty of using selabel_lookup instead of
matchpathcon. Therefore as a SELinux user, I would rather keep
matchpathcon program. Would it be difficult to implement option 2
"update matchpathcon to use selabel_open() and friends"?

That being said, if another option is chosen, I will add "alias
matchpathcon=selabel_lookup -b file -k" to my shell configuration and
be good with it. This would work for me because I never used any
option that matchpathcon provides.

Anyway, thanks for working on this subject!
Nicolas
