Looks like Fedora policy allowed both permissions unconditionally (no
boolean) to all unconfined domains.
So SECINITSID_KERNEL checks will pass but are rather pointless unless
Fedora decides to define separate
integrity/confidentiality rules and wrap them each with a boolean
(e.g. allow_kernel_integrity_violation,
allow_kernel_confidentiality_violation) so that an admin can disable
them to enforce lockdown independently
of the lockdown module.

Android policy allows all domains :lockdown confidentiality but
prohibits (neverallow) integrity permission from
being allowed on user (production) builds. They do allow apps
:lockdown integrity on debug builds for debugfs
kcov usage, so that rule would need to be fixed if switching to always
using SECINITSID_KERNEL or the checks will
start failing.

Did all the issues around invoking audit from arbitrary contexts in
which security_locked_down() is called get sorted?
If not, we'll still have that as a potential problem if permission is
denied or an auditallow rule is defined on lockdown.

Can we get Linux distro and Android folks to speak as to whether they
consider the check in this reduced form to still be useful or whether
we should just remove it altogether?
