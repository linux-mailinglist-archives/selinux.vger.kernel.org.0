I am thinking of implementing "disabling 'htable' using a new Kconfig 
(e.g. CONFIG_IMA_DISABLE_HTABLE)".  That is, not using the var 
ima_htable or ima_lookup_digest_entry() if that CONFIG is set.
So the duplicate measurements are allowed when the CONFIG is set.
This would cover all the measurement scenarios through a single CONFIG 
setting.

I am not planning to implement it as a "per measurement rule".

Sorry it wasn't clear in my earlier response.
