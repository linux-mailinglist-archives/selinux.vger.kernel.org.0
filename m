Ignore this, I was trying to avoid having to add a vm_ops mprotect(),
which Andy pointed out was silly.

Andy proposed taking full RWX in MAXPERMs, but really we only need "can
writes ever happen to this page", as that allows the SGX driver to avoid
having to track if a page has been mapped PROT_WRITE by any VMA in any
process.

Ignore all this, again I was trying to avoid hooking mprotect().
