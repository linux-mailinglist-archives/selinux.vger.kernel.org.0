Oh wait... I looked closer at what the test is actually doing with the
-i options and I get it now. On the client side it extracts the
per-socket IP option and expects to receive that from the server as
its reported peercon. And on the server side, it also doesn't actually
send the peercon, but rather sends whatever is set on its socket's IP
options... That is indeed wrong and your patch fixes it correctly.

However, I'm pondering whether in the seq server case we shouldn't
change the approach a bit... Currently (after your patch) we are
basically testing the "unified" socket-level peercon and that forces
us to restart the server. But we could also ignore the socket-level
peercon in case of SOCK_SEQPACKET and instead extract the per-packet
peercon via IP_PASSSEC and SCM_SECURITY control messages, like we do
in tests/inet_socket/server.c in the SOCK_DGRAM case. I think this
should be the main way for users to get peercon when using
SOCK_SEQPACKET SCTP sockets with multiple peers and we should test it
with higher priority than the socket-level peercon. This means we
would have to use plain recvmsg() instead of sctp_recvmsg() in
sctp_server.c, but that shouldn't be a problem as we don't need to
extract sctp_sndrcvinfo nor msg_flags there.

If you don't want to mess with it, I can take this patch as-is (maybe
with improved commit message) and propose the above in a separate
patch.
