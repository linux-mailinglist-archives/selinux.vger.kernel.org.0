That's interesting.  Does that mean that your original patch made it
to the mailing list but somehow didn't make it to the lore archive?  I
just (re)checked and there is no record of your patch in the archive
or the patchwork instance.

How did the kernel test robot get the patch to test?  Does it know to
go fetch GH PR URLs?
