FWIW, not rebasing the -next branches would likely work out okay for
most release cycles, we just happen to have a SELinux/IMA patch which
has a dependency on code that was merged during the v5.12 merge window
so we need to rebase selinux/next at the very least and since the
audit/next branch is still empty I figured I might as well rebase that
too.

I suspect this will have little to no impact on anyone, but I wanted
to let you folks know regardless.  No one likes surprises when it
comes to upstream trees.
