Hello, this is done when a parameter such as "--optimize=1" is given
to "python setup.py install". Such a parameter is described in Arch
Linux packaging guidelines
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Python_package_guidelines#distutils).
Nevertheless I agree it seems to be left to distributions whether to
bytecode-compile Python modules.

What is the reference you are using for [1]? Why would this be
annoying? For example, do you use a non-standard way of generating the
bytecode which is not compatible with the one that would be generated
by the package itself?

My main motivation behind this patch is to remove lines such as this
one from Arch Linux's PKGBUILD:

/usr/bin/python3 -m compileall "${pkgdir}/$(/usr/bin/python3 -c
'import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])')"

(Example from https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=selinux-python&id=dd87f7ae1d636a02bf404ed527a27022ee5d2ab3)
As every Makefile installing Python scripts has everything that is
needed to build this command line, it is much simpler for "make
install" to perform the bytecode-compilation directly instead.
Nevertheless, as there is an interest to keep bytecode-compilation out
of the "make && make install" process, I will rework my patches to
make it optional (so that Arch Linux and maybe other distributions can
invoke it, but not Buildroot).

Thanks,
Nicolas
