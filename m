When we change things as significantly as we are doing here, i.e.
shifting some of the labeling away from the endpoint to the
association, I much rather we do it as a chunk/patchset so that we can
review it in a consistent manner.  Some of that has gone out the door
here because of what I view as recklessness on the part of the netdev
folks, but that doesn't mean we need to abandon all order.  Let's get
all the fixes and repairs queued up in a single patchset so that we
can fully see what the end result of these changes are going to look
like.  Further, I think it would be good if at least one of the
patches has a very clear explanation in the commit description (not
the cover letter, I want to see this in the git log) of what happens
with respect to labeling on the server side, the client side, during
socket peeloffs on both ends, and how multiple associations are
handled.  My hope is that this should give us all a more consistent
view, which will be very important moving forward if netdev is going
to act independent of the other subsystems.
