The visionary end state goal would be to allow one to specify some
kind of option in a travis-ci configuration and get a SELinux-enabled
image on which we could perform travis-ci validation of
selinux-testsuite, selinux userspace, and maybe even the kernel.  I
don't think that is possible in the near term though and will require
changes to travis-ci itself.  At the moment our travis-ci validation
of the testsuite and userspace is limited to building and in the
latter case running some limited tests that do not depend on having
SELinux on the host.

The nearer term goal is to minimize obstacles to using SELinux in
Debian, one of which is the need to install Debian and then install
SELinux as a separate step (with two reboots along the way) rather
than an installer option.  We can't use that approach in travis-ci
AFAICT because we cannot reboot the instance and then proceed with
testing.  If we can tell the installer to include the necessary grub
and pam configurations up front and to label the filesystems during
installation (which can happen even while SELinux is disabled in the
kernel; only requires filesystem xattr support), then we can avoid the
need for any extra reboots post install.
