Specifically, an SGX2 enclave will have its heap mapped as RW, but without any pages populated before EINIT. Then when the enclave needs a new page in its heap, it issues EACCEPT, which will cause a #PF and the driver will respond by EAUG a new EPC page. And then the enclave will be resumed and the faulted EACCEPT will be retried (and succeed).

> When we talk about EPC page permissions with SGX2 in mind, I think we should distinguish between initial permissions and runtime permissions. Initial permissions refer to the page permissions set at EADD. They are technically set by "untrusted" code so should go by policies similar to those applicable to regular shared objects. Runtime permissions refer to the permissions granted by EMODPE, EAUG and EACCEPTCOPY. They are resulted from inherent behavior of the enclave, which in theory is determined by the enclave's measurements (MRENCLAVE and/or MRSIGNER).

I think EXECMOD would fit better than EXECMEM for this case; the former 
is applied for RW->RX changes for private file mappings while the latter 
is applied for WX private file mappings.

FILE__READ checked to enclave file upon open().

FILE__READ revalidated and FILE__EXECUTE checked to enclave file upon 
mmap() for PROT_READ and PROT_EXEC respectively.  FILE__WRITE not 
checked even for PROT_WRITE mappings since it is a private file mapping 
and writes do not reach the file.  EXECMEM checked if any segment 
permission has both W and X simultaneously.  EXECMOD checked on any 
subsequent mprotect() RW->RX changes (if modified).

FILE__READ checked (SGX1) or both FILE__READ and FILE__WRITE checked 
(SGX2) to /dev/sgx/enclave upon open().  Assuming that we are returning 
an open file referencing the /dev/sgx/enclave inode and not an anon 
inode, else we lose all subsequent FILE__* checking on mmap/mprotect and 
trigger EXECMEM on any mmap/mprotect PROT_EXEC.

> void *enclave_base = mmap(NULL, <enclave size>, MAP_SHARED, PROT_READ, enclave_fd, 0); /* Only FILE__READ is required here */

FILE__READ revalidated to /dev/sgx/enclave upon mmap().

FILE__READ and FILE__WRITE revalidated to /dev/sgx/enclave upon mprotect().

FILE__READ revalidated and FILE__EXECUTE checked to /dev/sgx/enclave 
upon mprotect().  Cumulative set of checks at this point is 
FILE__READ|FILE__WRITE|FILE__EXECUTE.

What would the step be for a SGX1 RW->RX change?  How would that trigger 
EXECMOD?  Do we really need to distinguish it from the SGX2 dynamically 
loaded code case?
