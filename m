It's generally a good idea when someone has provided feedback on a
patch to limit the changes in the next revision to just those changes
which have been suggested.  It helps to keep the patch focused on the
original issue, makes the follow-up reviews easier, and shortens the
develop/reverge/merge cycle.  It generally isn't too bad of a problem
in the SELinux code, but there are other subsystems where several
large patch revisions have been wasted because the patch author lost
focus and started making additional changes outside the scope of the
comments.  If you want to submit the additional changes anyway, my
recommendation would be to split them out into a second patch in a
patch series (make sure the original patch is first!).

Of course the best solution is always to ask if you are unsure :)
While I don't check my upstream email quite as often as some folks
here, I promise to respond to any follow-up questions if no one
answers first.

... and please don't let our small nitpicks discourage you from
submitting patches, we really do appreciate help and contributions :)
