+The following */proc/self/attr/* filesystem files are used by the kernel
+services and via libselinux (for userspace) to manage setting and reading of
+security contexts within the LSM defined data structures:
+
+*current*
+
+- Contains the current process security context.
+
+*exec*
+
+- Used to set the security context for the next exec call.
+
+*fscreate*
+
+- Used to set the security context of a newly created file.
+
+*keycreate*

+- Used to set the security context for keys that are cached in the kernel.
+
+*prev*
+
+- Contains the previous process security context.
+
+*sockcreate*
+
+- Used to set the security context of a newly created socket.
+
+### Core LSM Source Files
+
+The core kernel LSM source files  that form the LSM are as follows:
+
+*include/linux/lsm_hooks.h*
+
+- Contains comments on each of the LSM hooks use and requirements, also
+  defines the main security structures for module stacking.
+
+*include/linux/lsm_hook_defs.h*
+
+- Defines each *LSM_HOOK* that will be expanded by macros in *lsm_hooks.h*.
+
+*include/linux/security.h*
+
+- *if/else* table of LSM hooks expanding those that are defined in the kernel
+  build or no-op those that are not.
+
+*security/commoncap.c*, *security/device_cgroup.c*
+
+- Some capability functions were in various kernel modules have been
+  consolidated into these source files.
+
+*security/inode.c*
+
+- This allows the 3rd party security module to initialise a security
+  filesystem. In the case of SELinux this would be */sys/fs/selinux* that is
+  defined in the *security/selinux/selinuxfs.c* source file.
+
+*security/security.c*
+
+- Contains the LSM framework initialisation services that will set up the
+  hooks described in *include/linux/lsm_hooks.h* and those in the capability
+  source files. It also provides functions to initialise 3rd party modules.
+
+*security/lsm_audit.c*
+
+- Contains common LSM audit functions.
+
+*security/min_addr.c*
+
+- Minimum VM address protection from userspace for DAC and LSM.
+
+#### LSM Program Loading Hooks
+
+The LSM hooks for validating program loading and execution (*security_bprm_\**
+functions) are listed with their *security/selinux/hooks.c* links (although see
+*include/linux/lsm_hooks.h* for greater detail). These hooks are used in the
+[**Process Transition Walk-thorough**](#process-transition-walk-thorough)
+section.
+
+*security_bprm_set_creds->selinux_bprm_set_creds*
+
+- Set up security information in the *bprm->security* field based on the file
+  to be exec'ed contained in *bprm->file*. SELinux uses this hook to check
+  for domain transitions and the whether the appropriate permissions have been
+  granted, and obtaining a new SID if required.
+
+*security_bprm_committing_creds->selinux_bprm_committing_creds*
+
+- Prepare to install the new security attributes of the process being transformed
+  by an *execve* operation. SELinux uses this hook to close any unauthorised
+  files, clear parent signal and reset resource limits if required.
+
+*security_bprm_committed_creds->selinux_bprm_committed_creds*
+
+- Tidy up after the installation of the new security attributes of a process
+  being transformed by an *execve* operation. SELinux uses this hook to check
+  whether signal states can be inherited if new SID allocated.
+
+*security_bprm_check->selinux_bprm_check_security*

+
+ The diagrams shown in
+[**Figure 2: High Level SELinux Architecture**](core_components.md#core-selinux-components)
+and **Figure 12: The Main LSM / SELinux Modules** can be used
+to see how some of these SELinux modules fit together with the
+*security/selinux* following files:
+
+*avc.c*
+
+- Access Vector Cache functions and structures. The function calls are for
+  the kernel services, however they have been ported to form the *libselinux*
+  userspace library.
+
+*exports.c*
+
+- Exported SELinux services for SECMARK (as there is SELinux specific code
+  in the *netfilter* source tree).
+
+*hooks.c*
+
+- Contains all the SELinux functions that are called by the kernel resources
+  via the *security_ops* structure or the *security_hook_list* in
+  kernels supporting multiple LSMs (they form the kernel resource object
+  managers). There are also support functions for managing process exec's,
+  managing SID allocation and removal, interfacing into the AVC and Security
+  Server.
+
+*netif.c*
+
+- These manage the mapping between labels and SIDs for the *net\** language
+  statements when they are declared in the active policy.
+
+*netnode.c*, *netport.c*, *netlabel.c*
+
+- The interface between ***NetLabel**(8)* services and SELinux.
+
+*netlink.c*, *nlmsgtab.c*
+
+- Manages the notification of policy updates to resources including
+  userspace applications via *libselinux*.
+
+*selinuxfs.c*
+
+- The *selinuxfs* pseudo filesystem (*/sys/fs/selinux*) that imports/exports
+  security policy information to/from userspace services. The services
+  exported are shown in the
+  [**SELinux Filesystem**](lsm_selinux.md#selinux-filesystem) section.
+
+*xfrm.c*
+
+- Contains the IPSec XFRM (transform) hooks for SELinux.
+
+*include/classmap.h*, *include/initial_sid_to_string.h*
+
+- Contains all the kernel security classes and permissions.
+  *initial_sid_to_string.h* contains the initial SID contexts. These are used
+  to build the *flask.h* and *av_permissions.h* kernel configuration files
+  when the kernel is being built (using the *genheaders* script defined in
+  the *selinux/Makefile*). These files are now built support the dynamic
+  security class mapping structure removing the need for fixed class to SID
+  mapping.
+
+*ss/avtab.c*
+
+- AVC table functions for inserting / deleting entries.
+
+*ss/conditional.c*
+
+- Support boolean statement functions and implements a conditional AV table
+  to hold entries.
+
+*ss/ebitmap.c*
+
+- Bitmaps to represent sets of values, such as types, roles, categories,
+  and classes.
+
+*ss/hashtab.c*
+
+- Hash table.
+
+*ss/mls.c*
+
+- Functions to support MLS.
+
+*ss/policydb.c*
+
+- Defines the structure of the policy database. See the
+  [**SELinux Policy Module Primer**](http://securityblog.org/brindle/2006/07/05/selinux-policy-module-primer/)
+  article for details on the structure.
+
+*ss/services.c*
+
+- This contains the supporting services for kernel hooks defined in *hooks.c*,
+  the AVC and the Security Server. For example the *security_transition_sid()*
+  that computes the SID for a new subject / object shown in
+  **Figure 12: The Main LSM / SELinux Modules**.
+

 ### Fork System Call Walk-thorough
 
-This section walks through the the ***fork**(2)* system call shown in
-[**Figure 7**](domain_object_transitions.md#domain-transition) starting at the
-kernel hooks that link to the SELinux services. The way the SELinux hooks are
-initialised into the LSM *security_ops* function table are also described.
-
-Using , the major steps to check whether the *unconfined_t* process has
-permission to use the fork permission are:
-
-1.  The *kernel/fork.c* has a hook that links it to the LSM function
-    *security_task_create()* that is called to check access
-    permissions.
-2.  Because the SELinux module has been initialised as the security
-    module, the *security_ops* table has been set to point to the
-    SELinux *selinux_task_create()* function in *hooks.c*.
-3.  The *selinux_task_create()* function check whether the task has
-    permission via the *current_has_perm(current, PROCESS__FORK)*
-    function.
-4.  This will result in a call to the AVC via the *avc_has_perm()*
-    function in *avc.c* that checks whether the permission has been
-    granted or not. First (via *avc_has_perm_noaudit()*) the cache is
-    checked for an entry. Assuming that there is no entry in the AVC,
-    then the *security_compute_av()* function in *services.c* is
-    called.
-5.  The *security_compute_av()* function will search the SID table for
-    source and target entries, and if found will then call the
-    *context_struct_compute_av()* function.
-
-The *context_struct_compute_av()* function carries out many checks to
-validate whether access is allowed. The steps are (assuming the access
-is valid):
--   Initialise the AV structure so that it is clear.
--   Check the object class and permissions are correct. It also checks
-    the status of the *allow_unknown* flag (see the
-    [**SELinux Filesystem**](#selinux-filesystem),
-    [*/etc/selinux/semanage.conf*](global_config_files.md#etcselinuxsemanage.conf)
-    and
-    [Reference Policy Build Options](reference_policy.md#the-reference-policy)
-    *build.conf* and *UNK_PERMS* sections.
--   Checks if there are any type enforcement rules (AVTAB_ALLOWED,
-    AVTAB_AUDITALLOW, AVTAB_AUDITDENY, AVTAB_XPERMS).
--   Check whether any conditional statements are involved via the
-    *cond_compute_av()* function in *conditional.c*.
--   Remove permissions that are defined in any *constraint* rule via the
-    *constraint_expr_eval()* function call (in *services.c*). This
-    function will also check any MLS constraints.
--   *context_struct_compute_av()* checks if a process transition is
-    being requested (it is not). If it were, then the *transition* and
-    *dyntransition* permissions are checked and whether the role is
-    changing.
--   Finally check whether there are any constraints applied via the
-    *typebounds* rule.
-7.  Once the result has been computed it is returned to the
-    *kernel/fork.c* system call via the initial *selinux_task_create()*
-    function. In this case the ***fork**(2)* call is allowed.
-8.  **The End.**

+
+Using **Figure 10: Hooks for the** ***fork**(2)* **system call**,
+the major steps to check whether the *unconfined_t* process has permission
