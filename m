OK, but you don't need the read_lock()/unlock(), rcu_head field in the
entries, and kfree_rcu(), right?

Right, so we would need a new function that does smp_store_release() instea=
d.

Looking at the implementation of rcu_dereference() and
rcu_assign_pointer(), they would probably be practically the same,
except the rcu_read_lock_held() check in rcu_dereference(). That and
they would clearly communicate that they are not doing actual RCU, but
just allow lockless traversal of an add-only hlist.
