If I understand part of CRIU correctly, then we only need read-access
for the current user. I am sure Andrei, Pavel or Cyrill will correct me
if I am wrong concerning map_files.

When I introduced clone3() with sett_tid to create process with a
certain PID I first did it without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check and there
were concerns that this would make it too easy to re-use PIDs. If I
understood it correctly. So if you are only asking about the damage that
could be done to the system if any user can create a process with any
PID via ns_last_pid or clone3(), then the damage could be easy re-use of
PIDs and probably easier re-creation of re-use PID problems.

I cannot comment on what damage could be done by allowing read-access to
map_files. Eric commented in another part of the thread that he thinks
that it might not be necessary at all.
