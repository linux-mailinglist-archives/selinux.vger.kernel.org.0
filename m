Ahh I thought it returned to 0. Not sure why I assumed that.

Depends on the stage:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/
If before_install, install or before_script returns a non-zero exit
code, the build is errored and stops immediately.
If script returns a non-zero exit code, the build is failed, but
continues to run before being marked as failed.

I put a false command in the script section and it kept plowing ahead
as you foretold.

I think the scripts are more maintainable outside of travis yaml files
as separate build scripts,
for two reasons:
1.  One can just execute the script locally, you can't, AFAIK, do that
with a travis yaml file.
2.  The issue can be avoided as they afford more control. Some other
projects I am a part of we only
     use script and after_failure. The bash scripts are set -e. I also
used this approach for the KVM
     selinux test run.

script:
  - ./.ci/travis.run
after_failure:
  - cat build/test-suite.log

We could adopt like what's above...
