Circa Linux 4.3, the SELinux kernel code was augmented to support
"extended permissions" with ioctl commands as the initial use case for
Android device driver whitelisting. This is supported in kernel policy
version 30 and later. A simple example can be found in the
selinux-testsuite under the ioctl test. See:
https://blog.siphos.be/2017/11/selinux-and-extended-permissions/
https://selinuxproject.org/page/XpermRules

This may still not provide you with the desired granularity. Depending
on the driver implementation, it may be possible to automatically
transition different "objects" managed by the driver into different
contexts through the recent SELinux anonymous inode labeling support
merged in Linux 5.12. There is an example of this for userfaultfd
inodes in the selinux-testsuite. We had previously looked at using
this support for /dev/kvm. Correct labeling of the inodes may require
modification to the driver depending on the approach desired.
