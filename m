avc_netlink_acquire_fd() isn't called by dbus-daemon in its current
release used in Fedora/RHEL.
So adding it there won't help.  We could add it to
selinux_status_open().  Just need to make sure we don't call
avc_netlink_open() twice there (it is already called in the fallback
case) or make it safe to do so.
