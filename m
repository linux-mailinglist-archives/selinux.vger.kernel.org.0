AFAIK, holding an RCU read lock does not guarantee that the pointer
doesn't change during the critical section (when you unwrap
rcu_asign_pointer() and rcu_dereference(), they are really just a
plain atomic read with some memory barriers, there is no extra magic
there), it only guarantees that any object that you rcu_dereference
will remain valid (i.e. it is not free'd/destroyed) for the duration
of the critical section.

If I understand the code correctly, then avc_latest_notif_update()
should reject inserts with old seqno, so it should become "frozen" so
from that point it should only receive the new access vectors.
Probably avc_flush() and avc_latest_notif_update() would also need to
be reordered to make sure no old entries are added in between, but
then it should be good.

It's definitely not unexpected to see (sequentially on one task) decisions like:

..., old, old, old, new, new, ...

but currently you could also get a pattern like:

..., old, old, new, old, new, new, ...

which I wouldn't say is expected. It is unlikely to be a big deal in
practice, but it just feels wrong...

Anyway, I concur that this is somewhat off-topic for this patch... I
raised it because I initially thought that it wasn't possible before
RCU conversion, only after, but then I realized it was possible before
as well.

Okay, I agree that this is out of scope, too. This loosely
synchronized system of kernel policy data + kernel AVC + userspace AVC
still feels weird to me, but I don't have a better solution at this
point, so I'll just have to live with it...
