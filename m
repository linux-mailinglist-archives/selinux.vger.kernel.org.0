In this case, the host process should tag *all* pages it *might* convert
to executable as ALLOW_EXEC.  LSMs can (and should/will) be written in
such a way that denying ALLOW_EXEC is fatal to the enclave if and only if
the enclave actually attempts mprotect(PROT_EXEC).

Take the SELinux path for example.  The only scenario in which PROT_WRITE
is cleared from @allowed_prot is if the page *starts* with PROT_EXEC.
If PROT_EXEC is denied on a page that starts RW, e.g. an EAUG'd page,
then PROT_EXEC will be cleared from @allowed_prot.

As Stephen pointed out, auditing the denials on @allowed_prot means the
log will contain false positives of a sort.  But this is more of a noise
issue than true false positives.  E.g. there are three possible outcomes
for the enclave.

  - The enclave does not do EMODPE[PROT_EXEC] in any scenario, ever.
    Requesting ALLOW_EXEC is either a straightforward a userspace bug or
    a poorly written generic enclave loader.

  - The enclave conditionally performs EMODPE[PROT_EXEC].  In this case
    the denial is a true false positive.
  
  - The enclave does EMODPE[PROT_EXEC] and its host userspace then fails
    on mprotect(PROT_EXEC), i.e. the LSM denial is working as intended.
    The audit log will be noisy, but viewed as a whole the denials aren't
    false positives.

The potential for noisy audit logs and/or false positives is unfortunate,
but it's (by far) the lesser of many evils.

This would effectively require *every* LSM to duplicate the SGX driver's
functionality, e.g. track per-page metadata, implement locking to prevent
races between multiple mm structs, etc...

How would an LSM associate a page with a specific enclave?  vma->vm_file
will point always point at /dev/sgx/enclave.  vma->vm_mm is useless
because we're allowing multiple processes to map a single enclave, not to
mention that by mm would require holding a reference to the mm.

vma->vm_file will always be /dev/sgx/enclave at this point, which means
LSMs don't have the necessary anchor back to the source file, e.g. to
enforce FILE__EXECUTE.  The noexec file system case is also unaddressed.
