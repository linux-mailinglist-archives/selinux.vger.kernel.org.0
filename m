FTR, I spent some time pondering on whether there is any bad
interaction with the sidtab live convert and I couldn't find anything.
The tricky part was splitting the policy load into load/commit/cancel
and that seems to have been done correctly.

As for rcu_dereference_check(), I'd prefer to pass the fsi->mutex in
there for better clarity. For example, if someone were to call one of
the functions containing it, they may not realize that some mutual
exclusion is expected around them. If the functions take the mutex as
an argument, they at least have to stop and think what to pass in,
which should eventually lead them down the right path.

This could be written as:

    seqno = newpolicy->latest_granting = oldpolicy ?
oldpolicy->latest_granting + 1 : 1;

...which is a bit easier to read to me, but others may differ.

These could also be merged into one line.

Other than the minor things above, I didn't find any logical issue in
this patch.

Since the mutex passing is going to be discussed in a separate patch
and the only other comments I had are minor nits (and which may not
align with your and/or Paul's preference), here you go:
