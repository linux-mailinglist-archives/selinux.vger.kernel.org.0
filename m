Is that true even though the entire function is called with 
rcu_read_lock() held? In any event, I can fix this for clarity.

We can't move the avc_ss_reset() before we have installed the new policy 
or else the AVC will update to the new seqno but possibly still get avd 
entries with the old seqno on security_compute_av() calls.  It is not 
unexpected that the AVC will keep seeing old decisions for a brief 
window; it is just as if they happened before the policy change.  Since 
we aren't providing a higher level synchronization in hooks.c to ensure 
that all permission checks made in a single hook (or at an even higher 
level, in a single system call) are done against the same policy, I 
don't think we gain anything by changing this. In any event, as you say, 
this is pre-existing and thus I don't want to change it as part of this 
patch.

This might be possible in the kernel but the design was to permit the 
security server and AVC to potentially live in different components / 
address spaces, with the original implementation in a microkernel where 
the security server was a userspace task.  Even now, the security server 
is providing decisions to userspace policy enforcers with their own AVC 
(from libselinux) and therefore still needs a way to synchronize policy 
changes (it sends policyload notifications via netlink with the seqno, 
and /sys/fs/selinux/access provides the seqno for the decision). Some 
improvements are certainly possible here but again I'd make those separate.
