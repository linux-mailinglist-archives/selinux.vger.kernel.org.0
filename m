I would discourage adding this info into the commit.  It clutters up
the commit description and is of little value once the patch has been
merged.

It has been my experience that those situations are rare enough that
in the case where there is some question it is easily resolved over
email.  It's not something worth worrying about.

Here is my perspective ... Cover letters for single patches are
annoying, either the information should be included in the commit
description itself or the information is really not that important
anyway.  I also tend to like seeing only changelog information in that
"informational" section so that it stays relatively clean and
uncluttered.  This means there really is no *good* place to put the
repo information for single patches, which is okay, because as I've
said before this really isn't a problem in practice; or at least it
hasn't been a significant problem in the roughly seven years I've been
maintaining the SELinux repo.

If this ever becomes a common issue I'm open to discussing this
further, but for right now let's not clutter things up to solve a
problem that really isn't a major issue.
