I don't think "complicated" is a fair assessment.  For SGX1 enclaves it's
literally a direct propagation of the SECINFO RWX flags.

I'm unconvinced that it would be remotely difficult to teach an enclave
loader that an enclave or hosted application employs SMC, relocation or
any other behavior that would require declaring RWX on all pages.

Huh?  Declaring overly permissive protections is only problematic if an
LSM denies the permission, in which case it will generate an accurate
audit log.

If the enclave/loader "requires" a permission it doesn't actually need,
e.g. EXECDIRTY, then it's a software bug that should be fixed.  I don't
see how this scenario is any different than an application that uses
assembly code without 'noexecstack' and inadvertantly "requires"
EXECSTACK due to triggering "read implies exec".  In both cases the
denied permission is unnecessary due to a userspace application bug.

Maximal protections that are too restrictive are completely orthogonal to
LSMs as the enclave would fail to run irrespective of LSMs.  This is no
different than specifying the wrong RWX flags in SECINFO, or opening a
file as RO instead of RW.

This is simply wrong.  The key requirement in the theoretical EAUG scheme
is to mmap() pages that have not been added to the _hardware_ maintained
enclave.  The pages (or some optimized representation of a range of pages)
would exist in the kernel's software mode of the enclave.
