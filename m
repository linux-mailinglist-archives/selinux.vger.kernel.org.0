Sounds good, I will implement the policy version bump.

I still believe the performance gained by converting to arrays
outweighs the cost of supporting older versions. See the discussion

Unless I misunderstand, I believe I addressed your concerns from v1
over using indices vs direct access to the arrays. From v2 --> v5, the
array conversion patch only changes how avtab_node elements are
allocated, access is the same as it is now.

For existing policies, I have given this a bit of thought and did some
performance testing. There are memory vs. runtime tradeoffs to
consider between counting the rules (like v5 does) and doing a realloc
(like v1 does). I'm of the opinion that the counting approach is
better overall, but I'll (r)enumerate the tradeoffs here for the
benefit of discussion.

For the realloc approach, a decent chunk of memory (currently 256 KB)
is wasted over-allocating the hash table slots because of the estimate
derived from the regular rules table. Extra memory for avtab_nodes are
allocated (either from overestimation or the dynamic growth factor)
during parsing, sometimes up to 1 MB, requiring a final realloc to
remove them. The growth factor chosen could have additional runtime
implications with regard to multiple reallocs. Regardless, this
approach has runtime costs and memory lost to overestimating the
hashtable slots needed (which in this case, can't be recovered except
through a rehashing of the whole table). 86 lines of code are added,
but it is fairly clean code.

The counting approach incurs a runtime penalty processing the
conditional rules twice. Memory is wasted constructing the struct
cond_node lists and corresponding struct cond_av_list elements twice,
but nowhere close to 1 MB. 23 lines of code are added, but it is as
you said hacky/ugly. The runtime penalty could be further optimized at
the cost of parsing code complexity and additional lines of code as
discussed earlier.

Some performance numbers from Fedora 38 running "perf stat -r 1000 -d
load_policy" (realloc is the v5 array conversion + v1 realloc
patches):

dev:       0.261174 seconds time elapsed ( +- 0.31% ) baseline
v5:         0.233972 seconds time elapsed ( +- 0.31% ) -10%
realloc:  0.226636 seconds time elapsed ( +- 0.34% ) -13.3%

Therefore, to your criteria stated above, both approaches are
empirically no worse than current in terms of performance or memory
used after load. But I believe the current counting approach is the
most reasonable given the lines of code added and the least amount of
memory used during parsing. For what it's worth, I have been
interested in designing a set of patches that would ultimately
refactor policy parsing from policy loading and would, as a side
effect, enable a simpler and more optimized counting approach for
older policies. If this is something you would entertain (even if it's
not exciting), then I will consider it for a future patch.

If you agree, I will introduce the policy version bump in the next
spin and also submit a patch to sepol. Otherwise, I can go back to the
drawing board.

Thanks for reviewing as always!
