Perhaps then the device should not be visible to user space at all, or 
at least not usable (which is the effect of MS_NODEV)? The file 
descriptor replacement thing seems to work also when /sys{,/fs/selinux} 
is not mounted in the mount namespace of the process, at least I haven't 
seen any problems.

I don't think there's any change to threat situation (a process which 
shouldn't have access to /dev/null, gains access by using 
/sys/fs/selinux/null? Not very credible) or even any other effect from 
this change, but I don't like it when selinuxfs always shows up when I 
grep for filesystems without nodev/noexec/nosuid. So the gain is visual.

What's the purpose and gain of having the filesystem mounted with 
dev,exec,suid, which for other filesystems than selinuxfs are the more 
dangerous options?
