It sounds ok to me as long as this feature is guarded by any sensible
capability. I don't want users to be able to randomly choose their pid
without any capability required.

We've heard the plea for unprivileged checkpoint/restore through the
grapevine and a few times about CAP_RESTORE at plumbers but it's one of
those cases where nobody pushed for it so it's urgency was questionable.
This is 5.9 material though and could you please add selftests?

It also seems you have future changes planned that would make certain
things accessible via CAP_RESTORE that are currently guarded by other
capabilities. Any specific things in mind? It might be worth knowing
what we'd be getting ourselves into if you're planning on flipping
switches in other places.
