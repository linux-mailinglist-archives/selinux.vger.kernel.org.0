Okay, that makes a lot more sense now.  I was a little shocked about
the difference in memory usage (it honestly didn't make sense), but
numbers don't typically lie so I figured I was just missing some small
point which was having a big impact :)

Regardless, a ~36KB bump in memory usage over the non-patched kernel
is still a small price to pay for the performance increase.
