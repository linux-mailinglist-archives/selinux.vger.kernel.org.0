It is better to just disable module that you do not use as removing the
modules probably causes them to be reinstalled on policy upgrades and
thus be re-enabled. This is likely not what one would expect.

those arent exactly the tools that come to mind first here, especially
not `sepolicy`. I would first and foremost mention `seinfo` and
`sesearch`.

It would be nice if this doc would have some examples. It should not be
hard since the doc targets refpolicy.
