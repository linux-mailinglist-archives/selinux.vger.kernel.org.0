Linker script? We just use a map file that has everything local except for what
we want to export.

Huh? I'm not following? If we just remove this, what would actually
break in libselinux?

This minor overhead on the first call to a routine to resolve the symbol isn't
really much overhead. After it's resolved its like an extra jmp or something.

If you really wanted to avoid relocation, couldn't you just link statically?

This seems like it might be good for specific issues, but I don't see how this
infrastructure really prevents or fixes anything besides complicating the code,
perhaps enlighten me?

I can see how perhaps for large things like python/glibc it could be
useful but for
libselinux this just seems like an over-engineered solution to a
non-existent problem.
