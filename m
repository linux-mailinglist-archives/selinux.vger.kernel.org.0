I recognize I probably haven't made my feelings about reverts clear,
or if I have, I haven't done so recently.  Let me fix that now: I
*hate* them.  Further I hate reverts with a deep, passionate hatred
that I reserve for very few things.  Maybe we have to revert this
change, even though I *hate* reverts they do remain an option; you
just need to be 99% sure you've exhausted all the other options first.

I suggest pursuing this before the revert to see what it looks like
and we can discuss it further during review.
