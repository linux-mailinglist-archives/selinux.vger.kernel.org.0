Yes, historically the SELinux users who cared about labeled networking
have typically had a stable network configuration.  Or at the very
least they haven't discussed problems with a dynamic network
configuration.

I can't say I'm an expert on all the various userspace device
managers, network or otherwise, but so long as they can execute an
arbitrary command then one should be able to use them to label the
device when it is added to the system.  Although perhaps we could make
this easier with docs and/or tools.

I would be curious to hear what the SELinux userspace folks think about this.
