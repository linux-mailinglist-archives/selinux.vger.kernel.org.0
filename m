Thanks. I will fix the description to address this.

Tushar: Before we introduced the mechanism to check supported
data-sources at compile time (patch 6/6 of this series), there was a
back-and-forth on whether “data_sources:=” should be a mandatory policy
option, or optional like “keyrings:=”. And we decided to make the
“data_sources:=” mandatory. But now that we have the compile time check
(patch 6/6 of this series), we can switch to make “data_sources:=”
optional (with the default to allow measuring all critical data – just 
like what you suggested below). I will make the code and description 
changes accordingly.

Makes sense.
To summarize, we will make the decision which sources to measure- based
on the sources defined in the allow list (in patch 6) and the sources
defined in “data_sources:=”. If “data_sources:=” is not present, we will
measure all sources defined in the allow list.
Hope my this understanding is correct based on your feedback.

Yes agreed. After the updates (based on your feedback) I stated above,
the behavior should remain consistent with what you described here.
