After the 5th iteration of the patchset and with everything having at 
least one trusted reviewer, I did ask the list if there were any 
objections and stated I would otherwise merge to v4.21:

http://kernsec.org/pipermail/linux-security-module-archive/2018-December/010209.html

Regardless, from now I'll also require signoffs from all of the major LSMs 
on these kinds of changes.

I'd have to say I also have concerns about the direction of LSM stacking 
and what its final goal is.  It seems to makes sense to be able to stack 
Apparmor inside SELinux or Smack, so that folk can use AA system 
containers on an SELinux or Smack host.

We've not seen other proposed use-cases for full stacking materialize in a 
sustained and viable manner.

Are there really any beyond AA inside a labeling LSM?  Because if not I 
think this is a reasonable goal state for LSM stacking until we concretely 
know otherwise.
