Beats me. All that SELinux policy stuff is over my head. ;)

Seriously, once they got the stacking patches applied they thanked
me for the help and disappeared until they decided to update the
kernel version and asked for help with the next round of patches.
They told me what they wanted to do, which was to run Android in
a container, but how they accomplished it was a set of details they
didn't share. I assume that you are right that they had to do
horrible things to either AppArmor or SELinux policy, or maybe both.
I also assume they wanted this as an environment to develop Android
applications, and may not have cared much about actual enforcement.
But they are happy users.

What I know is that there is a community out there using it. I think
you're right that the way they're using it would be displeasing to
most of us.

OK, they're a teeny bit extensive.
