I had asked about the motivation for the patch and didn't see any
reply.  I had also noted that we have several overlapping utilities
there that ought to be coalesced or dropped.  Anyway absent some
compelling motivation for this patch I don't think it warrants merging
right now.

There was also this one that I deferred to the distro maintainers to decide on:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11284945/

Otherwise, looks good to me.  I agree that we don't want to include
the setools-breaking change until after this release.
