I would be okay with only adding a skb extension when we needed it,
which I'm currently thinking would only be when we had labeled
networking actually configured at runtime and not just built into the
kernel.  In SELinux we do something similar today when it comes to our
per-packet access controls; if labeled networking is not configured we
bail out of the LSM hooks early to improve performance (we would just
be comparing unlabeled_t to unlabeled_t anyway).  I think the other
LSMs would be okay with this usage as well.

While a number of distros due enable some form of LSM and the labeled
networking bits at build time, vary few (if any?) provide a default
configuration so I would expect no additional overhead in the common
case.

Would that be acceptable?
