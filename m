I do not agree with that. The idea of MAC is Mandatory (centralized) Access
Control. The idea of SELinux is "Flexible MAC". Least privilege is an optio=
n.

Op made it clear that this is not an option right now. Also keep in mind
that tcp server listens on behalf of sshd which will be confined once
SELinux transitions tcpserver from unconfined_service_t to sshd_t as per
my example earlier.

It is not ideal, granted, but there are subtile details to
consider. Things are either black or white.
