Yes, it is mostly a legacy of the original tight coupling of kernel
classes/permissions to policy and hardcoded assumptions about
different default behaviors for processes (subjects) versus objects
(which these days are at least mostly configurable via default rules
and the like).  So we could probably eliminate the hard requirement
here on process transition.  Just not sure it would yield a very
usable system if you loaded such a policy.

You're welcome.  Another thorny spot for new policy writers is likely
when/how to use the various fs_use_* rules and when to use genfscon
(and at what granularity); script/selinux/mdp at least will
auto-generate a sane default set for you based on kernel
configuration.  And unfortunately we've grown a set of hardcoded logic
around specific filesystem types that need to get generalized and
turned into policy-driven rules, as per
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel/issues/2.
