I've used kernel built without CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE from Ondrej'=
s COPR
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/omos/drop-selinux-disable/ and trie=
d few
scenarios:

1. selinux=3D0 on kernel command line

everything works as expected

2. SELINUX=3Ddisabled in /etc/selinux/config

system boots, userspace considers SELinux disabled, /sys/fs/selinux is not
mounted. The only noticeable change
is in process list:

$ ps Z
LABEL                               PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
kernel                              552 pts/0    Ss     0:00 -bash
kernel                              574 pts/0    R+     0:00 ps Z

If I get it right, SELinux is enabled but it's not initialized and SELinux
checks are not processed - always return 0 as allowed. So there should be n=
o
real externally visible difference between selinux=3D0 and SELINUX=3Ddisabl=
ed

3. no /etc/selinux/config

SELinux is disabled in userspace but /sys/fs/selinux in mounted. It's due t=
o
check in libselinux which doesn't umount /sys/fs/selinux when there's no co=
nfig
file. Maybe this could be improved.


So I my findings are correct, it should be quite straight and easy change f=
or
the distribution. Even though userspace tools like anaconda and ansible sti=
ll
uses /etc/selinux/config to disable SELinux, it will have similar effect as
selinux=3D0. But it doesn't mean we will not try to change them to set seli=
nux=3D0.


So I've started to compose Fedora Change proposal

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux/Changes/Disable_CONFIG_SECURITY_SELI=
NUX_DISABLE

It's not complete yet, but I believe it contains basic information. I'd
appreciate if you can help me with text, phrases and references so that it =
would
be easy to sell it as security feature to Fedora community :)
