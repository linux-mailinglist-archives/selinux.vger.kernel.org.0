Well, we pin the testsuite to a fixed commit and bump it manually as
needed/wanted, so we generally don't see failures that are fixed
quickly. But I don't recall many (non-false-positive) failures
appearing on kernel-secnext in the past few months either.

I don't know if it is possible to subscribe to test failures (I'd
guess not). There is a notion of test maintainers, who are defined
internally, who receive reports of failures for review before they are
sent to relevant recipients, but this is an internal-only facility...
Maybe you can try filing a feature request at [1]?

It seems that wherever the service can be started by systemctl, it is
called "nfs-server" (on RHEL-7 there is also an alias "nfs"), so I
think we can stick to just 'systemctl start nfs-server' and it should
work most (if not all) of the time.
