Yes, I do.

This feature greatly adds up into MAC access control [1], [2] for perf_events,
additionally to already existing DAC [3]. However, there is still the whole
other part of MAC story on the user space side.

Fortunately MAC and DAC access control mechanisms designed in the way they are
naturally layered and coexist in the system so I don't see any contradiction
in advancing either mechanism to meet the demand of possible diverse use cases.

There is no much rationale in providing favor to one or the other mechanism
because together they constitute complete integrity of security access control
and configurability for diverse use cases of perf_events.

It is just enough to imaging some HPC cluster or Cloud lab with
several hundreds of nodes to be upgraded.
