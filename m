This does not seems to be possible for now. The RCU lock circulates the
whole list access while there might be more LSM related rules within the
list. Besides we cannot release the RCU lock before allocation, this
would trigger an UAF immediately.

Will send a v2 adding a GFP mask for security hook as well as
ima_lsm_copy_rule.
