I think i tried that, but the extended attribute filesystems need to be
re-initialized AFAIK else fixfiles just returns with "Operation not
supported". Not sure if that strictly speaking requires a reboot or if
you can somehow do that with mount -o remount?

Is there a way to enable labeling support of extended attribute
filesystems without rebooting?

I think there was a patch recently by the Red Hat ContainerOS people to
enable labeling from the initramfs (ie labeling when SELinux is
disabled) How does that relate to the issue where I am seemingly not
able to relabel the filesystem after adding a fsuse trans rule without
rebooting? (ie SELinux is enabled, there is a fsuse xattr but the
filesystem hasnt been re-initialized yes and setfiles reports "operation
not supported")
