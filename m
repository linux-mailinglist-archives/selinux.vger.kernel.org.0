Me either, but I see no alternative other than taking/releasing the 
mutex in selinuxfs, at which point it is truly no different than 
fsi->mutex.

I think if you look at the 2nd patch, you'll see that this won't work 
because security_load_policy() is then changed to return newpolicy to 
the caller, and selinuxfs then calls selinux_commit_policy() after 
updating selinuxfs.  In order to provide the full exclusion guarantee, 
we need the mutex held across both security_load_policy() and 
selinux_commit_policy(). At that point we'd have to take the mutex 
lock/unlock up to selinuxfs and we already have fsi->mutex there.  This 
load_mutex was just to document the exclusion guarantee at the 
security/ss/services.c level and provide something we could pass to 
lockdep for safety checking when/if we convert to RCU.  If you really 
don't like it (and I'm not super excited about it myself), then I think 
I'll just put a comment in security_load_policy() explaining why we 
don't need to take policy read-lock there and drop load_mutex.  Thoughts?
