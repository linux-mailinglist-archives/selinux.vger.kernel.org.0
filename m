I don't think we want to directly expose the existing data structures
from include/sepol/policydb/*.h (or at least not without a careful
audit) since those are often tightly coupled to policy compiler
internals and/or the kernel or module policy formats. Creating an
abstraction for each with a proper API in new definitions in
include/sepol/*.h would be preferable albeit more work. There was a
proposal a long time ago from the setools developers to create an
iterator interface and accessor functions for each data type, see
https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/200603212246.k2LMkRNq028071@gotham.columbia.tresys.com/.
