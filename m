I'm still not entirely sure this really solves the problem, it just
changes it slightly.  You would now need to worry about making sure
you have the right types defined in the policy, and I'm not sure we
can generalize the world's network configurations into a reasonable
set of types.  Not to mention the problem of mapping the
subnets/interfaces to those types.
