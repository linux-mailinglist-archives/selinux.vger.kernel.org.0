Yes I think the module store could be copied from /usr/share/factory to
/var/lib by systemd-tmpfiles if applicable and it should not cause
issues but the overal idea of using a mutable policy on a volatile root
seems counterintuitive. For a readonly monolithic policy it is probably
robust and simple.
