IMHO that sounds like an overkill in this scenario. I don't think it
makes sense to do the LSM check here (or at least not against the
current task's creds), because it is not the current task that wants
to communicate with the daemon, it just wants to to access some
directory on the system that just happens to be special to the kernel,
which needs to do some communication on the side to service this
request. So if we do want to do any LSM check here, there should at
least be some "bool internal" flag passed to the LSM, signalizing that
this is an internal read/write operation that wasn't directly
initiated/requested by the current process. SELinux could then either
use the kernel secid instead of the current task's secid or skip the
check completely in such case.

I'd like Stephen to weigh in on this, but it looks he might be on
vacation right now...

With SELinux at least, what is allowed or denied is defined in the
policy. And the policy usually defaults to everything denied and then
you add rules to allow what needs (and makes sense) to be allowed.
Since until kernel 5.8 random processes didn't need to write to pipes
created by the automount daemon, it has never been explicitly allowed
and so the automounting now fails. It is in no way obvious that all
processes should have the permission to talk to the automount daemon
just to traverse the filesystem...
