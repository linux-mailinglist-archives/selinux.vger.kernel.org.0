These suggestions look good to me. Actually I even began writing a
small patch to show resolved blockinherit statements as "( ;
blockinherit b", because otherwise the parentheses are wrong in the
output of "secil2tree -A resolve secilc/test/policy.cil".

About introducing a new comment statement, it sounds like a whole new
feature just designed to make a niche tool work in a simple way. In my
humble opinion I prefer seeing regular comments in secil2tree dumps,
which has the advantage of being an existing syntax, being easy to
read, etc. But this is what I feel and of course if you prefer the way
you suggest or if someone else has a different preference, it would be
all right. And I might have missed the whole point of introducing
comments which are not discarded by CIL parsers and what advantage
this approach gives.

Cheers,
Nicolas
