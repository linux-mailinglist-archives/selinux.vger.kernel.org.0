There's something slightly awkwardly worded in this sentence.  Maybe 
"The policy allows system administrators and users to continue using 
working methods that they learned before becoming familiar with SELinux"?

It might be helpful to include a sample setsebool command here?

It could also potentially result in system breakage.

unconfined

I would also suggest that logging root in as staff_u:staff_r and 
escalating to staff_u:sysadm_r or another role for administrative tasks 
would be a reasonable hardening step that could be more suitable for 
many use cases.

If the goal is escalating order of difficulty, I would say that using 
fine grained network labeling is probably more difficult than "Custom 
Policy", particularly because implementing it will probably require some 
custom policy work.
