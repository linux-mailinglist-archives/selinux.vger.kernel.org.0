I checked this patch file in multiple text editors, but couldn’t find
any instance of period followed by two spaces. I will double check again 
all the patches for multiple spaces, and remove them if any.

Thanks for the suggestion.
I will use “Define ima_measure_critical_data, a new IMA hook, to ...”

I simply used the description from p_b_m()
* @eventname: event name to be used for the buffer entry.

By "buffer entry" do you mean a record in the IMA

Yes, a record in the IMA measurement list.
Will remove the future tense and reword it to something like:

  * @event_name: event name for the buffer measurement entry
-or-
  * @event_name: event name for the record in the IMA measurement list

Sounds good. Will do.

> The "/**" is the start of kernel-doc.  Have you seen anywhere else in
My impression was the hooks in ima_main.c e.g. ima_file_free()
ima_file_mmap() required the double-asterisk ("/**"), and internal
functions like ima_rdwr_violation_check() require a single-asterisk
("/*")

kernel-doc.rst suggest the double-asterisk ("/**") for function comment
as well.

Function documentation
----------------------

The general format of a function and function-like macro kernel-doc 
comment is::

   /**
    * function_name() - Brief description of function.

Please let me know if you still want me to remove the double-asterisk
("/**") here.

Thanks. I will remove the prefix "@" from <variable name> in the longer 
function description.

Good point. I will switch to either size_t or unsigned int.
