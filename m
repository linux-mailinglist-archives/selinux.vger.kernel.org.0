Re-declarations were never supposed to be allowed (other than the
declaration of types and typeattributes when using the -m flag), but
there were not sufficient checks being done when copying the CIL AST
when expanding macro calls, resolving the inheritance of blocks, and
things like that.

The result was behavior that depends on the rule order and one of the
principles of CIL is that there would be no rule order dependencies.

I can see that this might be useful behavior.

I think that overriding the macros would make more sense, but I'll
have to think about it.

It would be a pain, but you could do something like:
(block B1
  (macro M1 (...)
    ...
  )
  (macro M2 (...)
    ...
  )
)

(block B2
  (block parent
    (blockinherit B1)
  )
  (macro M1 (...)
    (call parent.M1 (...))
    ...
  )
  (macro M2 (...)
    (call parent.MA (...))
    ...
  )
)

It is true that in-statements are resolved before inheritance, so what
you have above would not work.

If you are just adding rules and not declarations, then you don't have
to put the rules in the block.
Example:
(block B1
  (block B
    (type t)
   )
)
(block B2
  (blockinherit B1)
  (allow B.t self (CLASS (PERM)))
)

It might be possible to attempt to resolve all in-statements before
inheritance as what currently happens and then try to resolve any
remaining in-statements after inheritance has been resolved.

I'll have to think about the problem a bit.

Thanks for the questions,
Jim
