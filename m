Yeah, genfscon is the way to say, hey this filesystem, all things have
this label. genfscon takes paths, for more specific labelling,
IIRC, cannot be used on rootfs; that feature only works for proc/sysfs
like pseudo filesystems.

Yes because there is no xattr support, so it would choke and die when
the kernel wants the xattr.

Here's some other things to consider:
1. There is no xattr support. You would need to see if that patch or
something equivalent was accepted and then what kernel
    version, and determine if your kernel supports it. Then at build
time for the image you would have to create that dotfile that contains
the
    labels and package it in the CPIO archive. Then you could use the
fs_use_xattr IIUC.
2. I could be mistaken, but I think in recent years I have seen
patches or articles that other FS types can be used for the initial
root filesystem
    now without a need for initrd, so you could, IIUC, boot directly
into a labelled ext4 filesystem. You would have to label that file
system during build.
3. Most linuxt things boot into an initrd and then pivot to the actual
root filesystem, you could do that as well.

This would take some digging likely to figure out, or find someone
that knows way more than me. That shouldn't be too terribly hard,
I don't know much.
