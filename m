And 'kata' is it's own kernel, but more like a container runtime - would
you like to call this a VM or a container?
There's whole bunch of variations people are playing around with; I don't
think there's a single answer, or a single way people are trying to use
it.

It's typically run without CAP_SYS_ADMIN; (although we have other
problems, like wanting to use file handles that make caps tricky).
Some people are trying to run it in user namespaces.
Given that it's pretty complex and playing with lots of file syscalls
under partial control of the guest, giving it as few capabilities
as possible is my preference.

> >   If the host has SELinux enabled then it can run without CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RESOURCE, but it will only be allowed to write labels that the host system understands, any label not understood will be blocked. Not only this, but the label that is running virtiofsd pretty much has to run as unconfined, since it could be writing any SELinux label.

Yep, we realise that; but when you're mainly interested in making sure
the guest can't attack the host, that's less worrying.
It would be lovely if there was something more granular, (e.g. allowing
user.NUMBER. or trusted.NUMBER. to be used by this particular guest).

For those with CAP_SYS_ADMIN I guess.

Note the virtiofsd takes an option allowing you to set the mapping
however you like, so there's no hard coded user. or trusted. in the
daemon itself.
