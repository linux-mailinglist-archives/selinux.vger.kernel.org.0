In the past there hasn't been much demand for a smoother installation process.  
If you are setting up a traditional Unix server system the Debian SE Linux 
installation thing doesn't make things much more difficult.  Past complaints 
about it have been more about an imagined difficulty of using SE Linux and have 
ended when I showed and wrote about how to do it (one time I showed 
screenshots of the process in an LCA lightning talk and didn't have problems 
with time).

I don't think that the people who maintain the Debian installation related 
packages would have a great objection to adding SE Linux features, although it 
might take a bit of time for it to migrate from Debian to Ubuntu.

We can make this a priority.
