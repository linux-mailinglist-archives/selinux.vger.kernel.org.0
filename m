just tried ppc64_defconfig + AUDIT=y, SECURITY=y, SECURITY_NETWORK=y, SECURITY_SELINUX=y

sparse will complain in the original version about:
  CHECK   security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.c
security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.c:389:28: warning: cast to restricted __le32
security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.c:389:28: warning: cast to restricted __le32

security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.c:431:23: warning: cast to restricted __le64
security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.c:431:23: warning: cast to restricted __le64

which is the same as 32bit ppc - after the patch is applied that is resolved
and and the generated ebitmap.o files are binary identical.

I just had chosen ppc6xx_defconfig as my big-endian test-target as SELINUX
was on there by default so I assumed it would be the most reasonable
compile-test target.

thx!
