Why would one need to detect it, though? For selinux-testsuite? For
that it will be sufficient if the REQSKB fix is applied before the
ASCONF fix. Anyway, this is bikeshedding and I don't insist on
splitting the patches, just that I don't see an obvious reason so I'd
like to understand why it's being done this way.

I don't see how the suffix is relevant to alignment to RFCs, but
anyway I'm beginning to doubt if the _FROM suffix makes that much
sense... Let's leave it at ASCONF_SOMETHING then. (But see below why I
still think it should be split into two permissions or apply only to
ADD_IP.)

I don't think that's necessarily true. 5.4 says "A sender MUST only
send a set primary request to an address that is already considered
part of the association." But the addresses in the association don't
all have to come from ASCONF, they can be also populated by the client
itself via CONNECTX. So unless I'm mistaken, it is possible to open a
multi-address association via CONNECTX and then let the remote peer
indicate its preferred primary address via SET_PRIMARY. If (at SELinux
level) I wanted to allow this scenario, but prevent the remote peer
from adding any extra addresses to the association, I wouldn't be able
to do so with this patch.

Hmm, I guess that might be a valid use case indeed... Though I wonder
if we shouldn't keep the "name" part in the permission name. At least
I get the impression that the "name" in  "name_connect" and
"name_bind" means we are checking against a port's label. Sorry if
that's a misunderstanding.

Well, yes, the kernel contains a lot of ugly code, but that's no
excuse to add more... Yet, this is another bikeshedding that is maybe
worth raising but not worth arguing about, so I'm not going to scratch
it further.

Well, yes, but none of that explains why we call
netlbl_sock_delattr(sk) unconditionally on disconnect. Shouldn't the
whole AF_UNSPEC block be executed only if sksec->nlbl_state ==
NLBL_CONNLABELED? Because of the guard in
selinux_netlbl_socket_connect_locked() the state can be only either
NLBL_CONNLABELED or NLBL_REQSKB here. In the case of NLBL_CONNLABELED,
deleting the NetLabel options is logical, but in the case of
NLBL_REQSKB we would be deleting options set by the user, which
doesn't seem right.

It is a pre-existing bug, but you are trying to exacerbate it even
more by reusing the conditional for SCTP, so perhaps worth addressing
beforehand.

One more side thought: It's weird that currently we will allow setting
the socket options in case of NLBL_REQSKB, but not in the case where
the socket has a NETLBL_NLTYPE_UNLABELED entry. In this case there are
no options set on the socket by NetLabel and it is marked as
NLBL_LABELED, which means that selinux_netlbl_socket_setsockopt() will
reject setting NetLabel options on it.

Oh, and while I'm at it - does anybody know what is the intent behind
the mysterious if-else in selinux_netlbl_inet_csk_clone()?
