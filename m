Agreed.  FWIW, I thought you were looking for a different approach for
the writers in your original mail.  Considering the multiple cache
fields, and the consistency requirements, I think the only realistic
solution would be to wrap them in their own struct/pointer referenced
by the inode_security_struct and use RCU on the read side.  Different
readers would obviously have the potential for different views, but
the cached values would at least be consistent for any given reader.
The downside would be the allocations necessary when updating the
cache, which I'm guessing would wipe out any gains from the cache ...
but that's just a guess.
