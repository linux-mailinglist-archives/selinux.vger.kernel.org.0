Yes, it does, especially considering that Linus seems to be rejecting
lockdown implementations that differ from the lockdown LSM.  The only
argument I can see for keeping the SELinux lockdown check is if people
wanted to be able to include it as part of a policy analysis, although
given the limited nature of the control I'm not sure how useful that
would be in practice.

This was one of the reasons for the "untested!" warning.  Like you, I
suspect the kernel domain has already been granted the necessary
permissions in deployed policies (I will be amazed if there are no
kernel threads which end up triggering a lockdown check), but even if
it did we need to make some sort of change to the existing code.
