Hi,
There seems to be some confusion:

* "make -k" does not stop the "make" command at the first error and
allows seeing all the errors when there are several ones. In my humble
opinion, it makes sense when compiling ("make all") and not when
running tests ("make test"), and this is actually what is right now in
Travis-CI. "make -k" returns a failure exit code when an error
happens.

* Travis-CI does not stop the job as soon as a sub-command fails. If I
understand correctly, this is what really bothers William, and I agree
this is a behavior that can be improved. According to
https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1066, a possible
solution could be to use "set -e", which could have unexpected
side-effects in launched commands. It is possible to "emulate set -e"
by adding exit statements, such as :

    - make install $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS -k || exit $?
    - make install-pywrap $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS -k || exit $?
    - make install-rubywrap $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS -k || exit $?
    # ...
    - make test $EXPLICIT_MAKE_VARS || exit $?

I have not tested whether this works on Travis-CI, but if it does, it
would be a nice improvement. I will take a look this week-end.

Cheers,
Nicolas
