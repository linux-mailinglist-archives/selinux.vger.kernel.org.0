My description of the issue was not very clear, my apologies. Here is
another tentative.

For some years, Arch Linux developers have been compiling their
official kernel (https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/linux/ ;
https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/tree/packages/linux/trunk)
with CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y even though SELinux was disabled by
default. In order to use SELinux, users were required to install some
packages (such as systemd with SELinux support) and to add "selinux=1
security=selinux" to their kernel command line. Last week, the
official Arch Linux kernel was updated to use
CONFIG_LSM="lockdown,yama,bpf". Booting a system with this kernel and
"selinux=1 security=selinux" was broken (D-Bus refused to start, as
well as all network services, because systemd failed to get some
important SELinux contexts through /proc/$PID/attr/... files). But
using "selinux=1 lsm=selinux,lockdown,yama,bpf" fixed this issue
(before, there was no lsm= command line).

Thanks for your quick reply! Anyway it seems that my issue was caused
by an incompatibility between selinux and bpf LSM. On my test system
(running Linux 5.10.11):

* Using "lsm=selinux,lockdown,yama,bpf" works (SELinux is functional,
the system boots fine)
* Using "lsm=lockdown,yama,selinux,bpf" works too
* Using "lsm=lockdown,yama,bpf,selinux" does not work
(/proc/$PID/attr/current raises "Invalid argument")

So it is important that "selinux" comes before "bpf" in CONFIG_LSM
(and "lsm" parameter). This fact seems to be known, as "bpf" was added
last in the default values of CONFIG_LSM options
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/security/Kconfig?h=v5.11-rc7#n280).
Is this documented somewhere? It is neither in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.11-rc7/bpf/bpf_lsm.html nor
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.11-rc7/admin-guide/LSM/index.html.
