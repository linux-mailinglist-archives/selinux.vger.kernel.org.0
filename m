It does make sense to use it as a subject label, but not for the
connect permission, where the convention is that the subject context
is a process context. While we don't have any hard rule against mixing
different "kinds" of contexts in the subject/target of a given
permission, it makes both figuring out AVC denials and reasoning about
policy harder and I want to avoid it wherever possible.

Yes.

I agree that we should think this through before making changes. I
likely won't have enough time to implement the fixes myself, but at
least I will try to provide some food for thought for whoever will
attempt to tackle this :)

My idea is to provide policy writers/users (particularly those who
don't want to enable peer labeling) a simple way to control the usage
of ASCONF on the machine (either at global or socket level). ASCONF is
quite a niche feature of SCTP and probably won't be used by most
applications (and the SCTP RFC mandates that it be used only in
conjunction with auth chunks, which is itself another niche feature).
Given that ASCONF has security implications, I see it as a natural
requirement to be able to allow a domain to use SCTP itself, but not
to process ASCONF commands from any peer.
