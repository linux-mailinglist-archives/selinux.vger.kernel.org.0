True, but since we know a giant set of changes is coming, I think it's
okay. As long there's kerndoc on the helpers, it should be clear what
they're for. And the commit log can include the context for why the
helpers exist. "In later patches, we'll replace secids with lsm_context,
so we need to use foo to do bar etc"

Yeah, that's fine. If you have to do a lot of work to split up a pair of
patches, I think that's fine to combine them. What I usually want to see
is a split of separable changes. Like, adding all the helpers: I can
look at those individually as I read the patch. Then the next patch
might swap a whole logical set of things like putting lsm_context into
the LSMs, but leaving all the interfaces alone. Then fixing the high
level things that use secids, etc.

But, really, the cover letter should cover the evolutionary steps the
series takes: that should serve as a guide for everything trying to
follow your thinking.

Right. Having a distinct verb in the helper name should solve all my
confusion. :)

lsm_context_to_secid() secid_to_lsm_context() smack_secid_to_lsm_export()
etc

I didn't mean life-cycle managed, but rather "opaque" to LSM. I just now
tried to construct an example, and have decided it's too crazy. :) The
benefits of your current system are that they are trivially able to be
put on the stack since they're a fixed size. The down side is that each
LSM must manage its own flags, etc. I will ponder alternatives after I
see the next version of your series.
