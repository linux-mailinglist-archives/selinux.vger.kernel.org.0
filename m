Dynamic tracking has an unsolvable race condition.  If process A maps a
page W and process B maps the same page X, then the result of W^X checks
depends on the order of mprotect() calls between A and B.

If we're ok saying "don't do that" then I can get behind dynamic tracking
as a whole.  Even if we settle on dynamic tracking, where that tracking
code lives is still an open IMO.
