"root" is a hybrid user (system processes are often associated with
root identity as well a the root login user) When a system process
associated with "system_u" creates a "file" in a directory with type
root_t (and there is no type transition rule telling selinux to
transition to default_t) then the file ends up with
system_u:object_r:root_t"

if the file was created by a "real" login user, then the label of the
file indicates that the context associated with the root login user was
wrong because generally the root login user shouldnt be associated with
"system_u"

> b) File created as testuser also has "system_u:object_r:root_t"

provided that the "testuser" identity is not a identity for system
services, than this indicates that both the processes creating the file
as well as the target directory of the file are mislabeled.

ensure that your login users are associated with the expected contexts,
and also ensure that your filesystems are labeled according to the policy
