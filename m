We we are mounting the file system (Most of the time), So we could add a
flag to indicate that this is a protected file system.

But we want to allow domains to follow container_file_t links that point
to container_file_t objects.  Just not follow them if they point to
other types.  This means there is no Protection that I could write to a
domain like unconfined_t to say only follow links when the types match. 
Or the types have allow rules.
