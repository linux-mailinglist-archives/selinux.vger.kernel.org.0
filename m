Now that everyone is getting past the summer holiday season, it would
seem useful to specifically clarify some of the LSM namespace
implementation details.

If one thing has come out of this thread, it would seem to be the fact
that there is going to be little commonality in the requirements that
various LSM's will have for the creation of a namespace.

Given that, the most infrastructure that the LSM should provide would
be a common API for a resource orchestrator to request namespace
separation and to provide a framework for configuring the namespace
prior to when execution begins in the context of the namespace.

The first issue to resolve would seem to be what namespace separation
implies.

John, if I interpret your comments in this discussion correctly, your
contention is that when namespace separation is requested, all of the
LSM's that implement namespaces will create a subordinate namespace,
is that a correct assumption?

It would seem, consistent with the 'stacking' concept, that any LSM
with namespace capability that chooses not to separate, will result in
denial of the separation request.  That in turn will imply the need to
unwind or delete any namespace context that other LSM's may have
allocated before the refusal occurred.

This model also implies that the orchestrator requesting the
separation will need to pass a set of parameters describing the
characteristics of each namespace, described by the LSM identifier
that they pertain to.  Since there may be a need to configure multiple
namespaces there would be a requirement to pass an array or list of
these parameter sets.

There will also be a need to inject, possibly substantial amounts of
policy or model information into the namespace, before execution in
the context of the namespace begins.

There will also be a need to decide whether namespace separation
should occur at the request of the orchestrator or at the next fork,
the latter model being what the other resource namespaces use.  We
believe the argument for direct separation can be made by looking at
the gymnastics that orchestrators need to jump through with the
'change-on-fork' model.

Case in point, it would seem realistic that a process with sufficient
privilege, may desire to place itself in a new LSM namespace context
in a manner that does not require re-execution of itself.

With respect to separation, the remaining issue is if a new security
capability bit needs to be implemented to gate namespace separation.
John, based on your comments, I believe you would support this need?

In order to be relevant, the configuration of LSM namespaces need to
be under control of a resource orchestrator or container manager.

What we hear from people doing Kubernetes, at scale, is a desire to be
able to request that a container be run somewhere in the hardware
resource pool and for that container to implement a security model
specific to the needs of the workload running in that container.  In a
manner that is orthogonal from other security policies that may be in
effect for other workloads, on the host or in other containers.

Hopefully the above will be of assistance in furthering discussion.

Have a good week.

As always,
