Hm... okay so probably you were indeed running into that bug. I tried
to reproduce the other race (I added a BUG_ON to help detect it), but
wasn't able to reproduce it with my (pretty aggressive) stress test. I
only managed to trigger it by adding a conditional delay in the right
place. So I now know the second bug is really there, though it' seems
to be very unlikely to be hit in practice (might be more likely on
systems with many CPU cores, though). The first bug, OTOH, is
triggered almost instantly by my stress test.

Unless someone objects, I'll start working on a patch to switch back
to read-write lock for now. If all goes well, I'll send it sometime
next week.

Thanks, but given the results of my testing it's probably not worth trying :)
