Sure, that doesn't surprise me, but that isn't the example Casey brought up.

This really should surprise no one at this point, but I care very
little about how long something might take, or how difficult it might
be if it is something we are going to have to live with
<dramatic_voice>forever</dramatic_voice>.  I'm sympathetic that this
work has been going on for some time, but that is no reason to push
through a bad design; look at the ACKs/reviews on the combined-label
patches vs the others in the series, that's a pretty good indication
that no one is really excited about that design.

Let me try and remove some ambiguity from that - I'm not going to
merge any combined-label APIs.  I'm not sold on the syscall-based API,
I'm open to other ideas, but it needs to support distinct per-LSM
labels that allow applications to identify which LSMs are active and
which labels belong to each.  In addition, I do not want any changes
to the existing procfs APIs as I want there to be zero chance we will
break existing applications; if existing applications need to be made
aware of a simul-multi-LSM world then they would need to change to the
new API, whatever that may be.

Whatever new LSM API we decide on, I want to see that developed and
merged first.  It obviously must be designed to support multiple,
simultaneously active LSMs.
