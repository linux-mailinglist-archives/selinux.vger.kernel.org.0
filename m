It's not really about Fedora vs. Debian - it's just that Fedora
recently became a low-hanging fruit thanks to Bill's userspace scripts
and the existing testsuite CI got broken recently by Travis/GCE kernel
upgrade and instead of throwing more kludges on it I wanted to go one
step further and switch it over to the KVM approach. My plan was to
just get something working quickly so I don't need to hold off on
merging patches nor tolerate broken CI. I assure you, if Bill did the
userspace scripts for Debian, I would just copy that and put Fedora on
the backlog ;)

Anyway, if no one picks this up, I most likely eventually will. I just
wanted to make it clear that this is not on my immediate TODO list and
in case someone would like to pick it up, they are encouraged to do so
and won't conflict with my attempts. I'd like to see it happen as much
as you do, but right now I need to catch up with other work so this
will have to wait a bit.
