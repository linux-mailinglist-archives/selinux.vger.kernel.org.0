I also understand your concern. That higher load time (and also memory
usage) is the cost of doing the conversion from the older binary policy
format in the kernel during load.

However, to reduce both load time and memory usage to the values in the
third test, the only action needed is recompiling the policy with newer
checkpolicy/libsepol, patches to which I also proposed.
