Good point.

After power failure and reboot there's no bind mountpoints from fixfiles
left.

I don't know. But it's up to users to decide. If they are not sure, they
should answer 'No' to /tmp clean up.

I'll send updated patch with this.

Given that I don't know what was the original motivation for the cleaing
code and users are asked whether they want to clean up /tmp and they are
warned that they would need to reboot after this operation, I'm not sure
how I would defend the change.

Thanks,
