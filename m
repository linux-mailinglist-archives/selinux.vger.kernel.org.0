I first built selinux/next (based on 5.4-rc1) before and after your 
patch using a config with many debug options enabled (including KASAN), 
which yielded wildly different percentages both before and after - don't 
remember the exact values (but still improved by your patch).

Then I built the same sources using the stock Fedora 31 release kernel 
config and got the 35% versus 2% figures, likewise an improvement.

Then I ran your reproducer just on the stock Fedora 31 release kernel, 
which happened to be 5.3-based, and got the 65% versus 2% figures that 
matched your results.  So I'm not sure what accounts for the difference 
in the before results between the stock Fedora 31 release kernel and 
selinux/next using the same config.  Could be a 5.3 vs 5.4-rc1 change, a 
change in selinux/next on top of 5.4-rc1, or something different in the 
build toolchain/environment used for the stock Fedora kernel versus my 
build host (which was running Fedora 31).

Regardless, I do see a significant improvement in all cases from the 
patch, only the degree of improvement differs.  So I'm fine with it. 
Might want to get a 2nd opinion from Paul McKenney all the same on the 
RCU bits.
