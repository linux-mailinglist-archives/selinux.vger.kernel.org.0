Uhmmm, loadable LSM modules if they ever happen will have a kernel config.
If not distros will carry a patch just like they have for unprivileged
user namespaces. Trying to force distros to allow out of tree code just
isn't going to work.

no, Casey is not. He is trying to find a path forward to get LSM
stacking upstream sooner than later. He has made proposals that
admittedly you have not liked, but he has at least tried to propose
ideas that could work within the insane set of constraints.
