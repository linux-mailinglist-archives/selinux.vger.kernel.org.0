After thinking about the above statement for a bit I started to doubt
the claim that re-declaring a macro allows you to fully replace it. It
is actually a true statement.

The added value of being allowed to replace macros over allowing you to
"insert into" existing macros is low in my opinion though and i stick to
my suggestion that allowing in-statements regardless whether you
insert-into a namespace declared manually or using inheritance should be
possible.

I would probably just don't allow re-declaring macros, blocks and
optionals for simplicity and instead I would focus on makeing
in-statements work more intuitively.

The 3.2 behavior of re-declaring blocks and macros is inconsistent
anyway because:

re-declaring a macro redefines the whole thing
re-declaring a block just behaves as a in-statement and allows you to
insert into an existing block when a in-statement cannot be resolved.

It seems as if we were allowed to re-declare macros and blocks just to
avoid having to address the current limitations of in-statements.

Best to just address the current in-statement limiations head-on
IMHO. Then we don't really need those block/macro re-declarations either
AFAIK.

It will yield a consistent and intuitive behavior, which minimizes confusion.

Its just hard to explain to a user:

You cannot insert into a1.b2 because b2 comes from inheritance but you
can insert into a1.b3 because a1.b3 was declared manually.

That is just unwieldy.
