Thanks, that was a good sanity check.  There are some minor diffs from
what I ended up with, but nothing substantive that I can see.

Although I'll be honest, the merge wasn't as bad as I thought it would
be; most of the fuzz was simply due shuffling and renaming of data
structures, which generally isn't too bad.  Although I'm still
building the kernel to test it, so let's see if that statement still
holds (although it looks like it passed Stephen's testing). ;)

If you haven't noticed already, the merge currently lives in the
selinux/next-queue branch; if you notice anything off, feel free to
send a fixup patch.

When looking at the combined diff between the two sidtab patches and
comparing it to your merge I did make a few additional small cosmetic
tweaks.  Assuming the testing goes well, I'll probably go over
everything one more time to make sure the style looks okay, but today
I was focusing more on the correctness.
