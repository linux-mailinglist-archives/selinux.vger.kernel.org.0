You are effectively already doing that by mounting with a context mount 
that assigns container_file_t or whatever type to the filesystem.  You 
don't need something new there.

You really don't want programs on the host OS that are acting on a 
container filesystem to ever follow any symlinks within it.  It just 
isn't a good idea; even if you limit it to intra-container symlinks, 
then an attacker could use the host process to overwrite some file 
within the container that wasn't directly writable by him.

In any event, I don't know how one would implement a check between the 
symlink and its target; you'd have to save the symlink information until 
you reach the final target and then call a hook with both of them.  And 
what if there are multiple symlinks in that path?  Symlinks to symlinks?
