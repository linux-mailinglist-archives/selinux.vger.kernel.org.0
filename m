Looks like it, but I have no idea if that's even correct behaviour
or not - access to posix ACL is supposed to be controlled by
the VFS.

Ok, I keep forgetting that only XFS has attr_list(3) interfaces
(which predate Linux VFS/syscall xattr support, IIRC) and that
interface requires userspace to pass ATTR_ROOT to retrieve trusted
namespace xattrs...

For while it's a silent content filter for one user interface, it's
an explicit request from another user interface. Make of that what
you will....

It's the on-disk format flag that says the xattr is in the "root"
namespace (i.e. requires "root" permissions to access). XFS came
from Irix which had different xattr namespaces for system, security,
etc, hence the stuff is stored on XFS is named somewhat differently
compared to native linux filesystems....

Cheers,

Dave.
