True, but then we need to preserve the server restarting to work
around the "pinning" of the socket-level peercon, which is a bit
awkward... Or we could separate the expected values for the two
peercons and test that the socket-level one is always the one from the
first connection, while the packet-level ones correspond to the actual
peer.

The problem with the socket-level peercon on a SOCK_SEQPACKET socket
is that due to the multi-peer nature of it we resort to setting it
based on the first peer and then just revalidate any new differing
peer contexts through the SCTP_SOCKET__ASSOCIATION permission. To me
it feels like a sort of desperate attempt to provide at least some
peer context, even if it might not be meaningful. It can be convenient
if you know you are going have just one peer context per socket (and
the policy enforces it), but other than that it's better to ignore the
socket peercon and just look at the packet peercons (which are always
accurate) or peel off each new association into a 1-to-1 socket, where
the socket's peer context is accurate.

I'm of the opinion that it would be better to not return any peercon
at all for sockets that might end up receiving from multiple peers,
like we do with SOCK_DGRAM/UDP sockets. (Now it's probably too late to
change it, but that's what I would propose if the SCTP support was
being introduced now.)
