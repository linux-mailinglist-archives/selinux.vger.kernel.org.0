Yes but that is not what I am saying. It does not work even when you
reboot. I tried to explain that:

You install a new policy and run fixfiles -F onboot && reboot (as one
should)

systemd will fail to compute create socket activated sockets. and so
these socket activated daemon fail to start.

One of the daemons is device-mapper, and so if you use LVM type stuff
you may end up with with a system that is only partially relabeled.

Not to mention that in the relabel target various other services that
are socket activated fail to start, and so  who know how else that may
affect things.

There is also this (however this might no longer be accurate):

systemd computes whether it can dynamically transition on boot. If the
systemd executable file has an invalid label and this computation fails
then systemd might just freeze in the first place.
