No, that's not how rcu_dereference_protected() works. You should only
call it when you know for sure that you are in a section that is
mutually exclusive with anything that might change the pointer. The
check argument is only used for sanity checking that this is indeed
true, but other than triggering a warning when RCU debugging is
enabled the result of the check is ignored.

If the returned pointer is NULL, it just means that the pointer hasn't
been assigned yet, i.e. that no policy has been loaded yet (this was
checked using selinux_initialized() before, but when we're under
policy_mutex, checking the pointer for NULL is possible and simpler).

BTW, you should've replied to [1], which is the merged patch that
introduced the code you are referencing :)

Yes, that's expected. The caller of security_read_policy() in this
case needs to ensure that state->policy_mutex is being held.
