I'm curious about this second measurement.  My apologies if you posted
it previously, this patchset has gone through several iterations and
simply can't recall all the different versions without digging through
the list archives.

Is there a reason why the second measurement isn't included in this
patch?  Or this patchset if it is too big to be a single patch?

Given just this patch I would prefer if you folded
selinux_event_name() into selinux_measure_state().  However, I agree
with you that the comments in the selinux_event_name() header block is
useful, I would suggest moving those into the body of
selinux_measure_state() directly above the calls to
ktime_get_real_ts64() and kasprintf().

Yes, I understand that you are using the time value as a way of
ensuring you always have a different event name and hence a new
measurement.  However, I was wondering if you would be okay if the
time was adjusted such that an event name was duplicated and a
measurement missed?  Is that a problem for you?  It seems like it
might be an issue, but you and Mimi know IMA better than I do.

Ooops, sorry about that!  I'm not sure what I was thinking there :)

How about "__security_read_policy()"?
