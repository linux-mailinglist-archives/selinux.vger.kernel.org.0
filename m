Thanks, cpio supporting extended attributes would be very helpful right now.=


After looking through the ref policy I see there is a genfscon statement for=
 rootfs which is what is labeling everything as root_t.

Would I break everything terribly if I removed that and setup an fs_use_xatt=
r for the rootfs?


Thanks,

Ian Merin
