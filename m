If we determine that policy can't be written to accomplish the
transition then maybe systemd will reconsider not wanting to set the
socket context using a .socket file option.

Having written many policy modules, some of which use the
type_transition statement for tcp_socket objects, I do not see how it
can be used to transition sockets created by systemd. And under this
circumstance I see that the selinux socket create hook would not be
able query the policy database for the port context since the port is
not known until the bind occurs but what about having the bind hook
set the socket context if it finds a sid for the port?

I want to create socket activation services using systemd and to have
the type of the socket being listened on be one that I've defined so
that I can write policy to control which source types can connect to
it.
