You're right, the removed modules are restored after reinstalling, 
disabled modules stay disabled. I had probably forgotten the extent of 
my hacked package.

Maybe the install script could choose to never install any modules which 
aren't present in the system, but then the users would miss any newly 
written modules. The pre-install script would probably need to record 
before installation which modules are removed (vs. then available 
modules) and then post-install could use this list to avoid installing them.
