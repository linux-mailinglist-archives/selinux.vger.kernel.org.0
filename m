owever it is the case where there are more than one denial at the same time=
. Im not sure how and when it might happen.

One thing I wondered about was why not build up a single string with
all of the permissions instead of generating multiple trace events?
In the previous discussion it was implied that this was due to
limitations in the tracing subsystem's filtering, and based on the
discussion thus far I'm guessing there is little desire for this
information if it can't be filtered on?

If that's the case then I think we are stuck with the tracing code
that currently lives in selinux/next, as I currently have little
desire to add more than one tracepoint in the SELinux permission
checking codepath.
