Yes. This is one reason that a compile time check is inappropriate.
You also have the case with SELinux where you can unload the module.
It's deprecated, but still possible.

If you boot with SELinux compiled in, but with security=none on
the boot line you also have a case where the compile time check is
inappropriate.

It isn't in Linus' kernel, but is available in Ubuntu.
The audit/IMA rule selection get hairy in the multiple
security module case, but you don't need to add that
for the proposed scheme to be flawed.
