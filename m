For a long time now I've wanted to expand my selinux/next kernel
testing to platforms beyond Fedora.  I believe that it not only helps
catch problems before the kernel is released, but it also helps ensure
that the underlying distro has all of the necessary pieces (userspace,
policy, etc.) in place to support the latest and upcoming kernels.

Unfortunately every time I've looked at the state of SELinux in Debian
I've run out of time before I got it working well.  I'm not even going
to get into the Debian package format :/

I would be very happy to see some work go into lowering the bar on
getting SELinux working on Debian.  My Debian experience is pretty
limited, but you can sign me up as a very enthusiastic beta-tester,
just point me at some docs and an ISO :)
