Hello,

I'm sorry for the long delay:  I was on PTO with limited internet

I thought about doing the MPTCP and selinux patches sequentially to
both avoid the possibly untrivial conflicts resultion issues and to
ensure that the mptcp patches are in place when the selinux ones are
applied, as there is a fuctional dependency.

Indeed it makes sense to me.

I think we can address that concern in a quite consolidated way. We
usually include in the MPTCP tree a (very limited) number of patches
that will not be submitted to the netdev because belong to other trees
and/or are handled/owned by others devel. 

We use the above e.g. to fix build and/or functional issues in our
self-tests caused by other subsystems without the need to wait for the
proper fix to land into vanilla. When such event happen, we simply drop
the local copy of the fixup patch.

We could use a similar schema in this scenario. We can include the the
LSM patches to the mptcp in our tree while the rework is in progress to
ensure that overall the effort really addresses the LSM issue.

We can rebase the LSM patches as needed to address conflicts as
needed/if/when they pops up.

Once that the mptcp patches will land into the LSM tree, we will submit
formally the LSM ones to you. During the process I'll check and ensure
that the LSM issue is really/still fixed. Would that work for you?

I would appreciate that addtional extra mile a lot, as it will allow a
(temporary!) fix to be delivered quite earlier than what the above
process will provide. 

Of course the deal is that I'll take ownership of pursuing the complete
fix till resolution.

Many thanks!
