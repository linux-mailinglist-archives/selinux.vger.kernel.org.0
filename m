Considering that the original patch is almost three years old at this
point, if you're interested in picking up this work I'd suggest
starting by picking one of the options above that you like the most
and preparing a patch(set) that works on the current development
trees.  At this point all I remember about this patchset is that it
existed.  If I'm going to spend the time to go back and re-review
something, I'd rather it be a bit more recent than three years ;)

Yes, the family needs to be represented in the policy and using
precedence as a guide I would suggest encoding the netlink family
types as object classes.  You'll need a generic netlink "default" for
those generic netlink families that aren't explicitly defined, but
that shouldn't be too hard to implement.
