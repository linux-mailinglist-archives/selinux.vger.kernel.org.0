Hence the comments in my mail from last Friday.

It seems to us that the path forward is to require the enclave
author/signer to express their intent to implement executable dynamic
memory, see below.

The VMA that is crafted from the enclave file is going to exist for
the life of the enclave.  If the intent to use executable dynamic
memory is specified when the enclave image is being built, or as a
component of enclave initialization, the driver is in a position to
log/deny a request to EAUG+mprotect whenever it occurs.  The sensitive
criteria would seem to be any request for dynamically allocated memory
with executable status.

The potential security impact of dynamically executable content is
something that is dependent on the enclave author rather then the
context of execution that is requesting pages to be allocated for such
purposes.  There is going to be an LSM hook to evaluate the SIGSTRUCT
at the time of EINIT, so all of the necessary information is there to
make a decision on whether or not to flag the VMA as being allowed to
support dynamically executable content.

It doesn't seem like an onerous requirement for this information to be
specified in the enclave metadata.  For optimum security, one could
perhaps argue that the ability to implement dynamic memory should have
been a specifiable attribute of the enclave, similar to the debug,
launch and provisioning attributes.

As we have indicated in the past, once the enclave is initialized with
permissions for dynamically executable content, the platform is
completely dependent on the security intentions of the author of the
enclave.  Given that, the notion of enduring significant LSM
complexity does not seem to be justified.

Which opens up another set of security implications to discuss but we will let
those lie for the moment.

Have a good day.
