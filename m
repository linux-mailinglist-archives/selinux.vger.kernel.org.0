So I understand correctly, what you're asking for is to change this section:

    if (is_sehash)
        return 0;

to this instead:

    if (is_sehash)
        return dentry_has_perm(current_cred(), dentry, FILE__SETATTR);

Is that correct?

That's a good point.  Is this not an issue for the selinux xattr
because the selinux check could prevent a process from changing the
label of a file it owns?


The background for this patch is that I have a fuse server that runs
in a user namespace.  It runs as root in that namespace and keeps all
the file system caps so that it can set selinux xattrs.  However, it
cannot set the sehash xattr as that needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the parent
namespace.  Looking at the code I thought that might have just been an
oversight but if it's intentional then do you have any suggestions for
how to make this work?  I'd rather not weaken the sandbox for this
process just so that it can set this one xattr.

Thanks,
Chirantan
