As a concrete example, an Android policy from a particular
device/firmware has 565 file types defined while a CentOS 8.4 policy
has 2990 file types defined.
There are no types in common between them. Both policies make use of
category sets for different purposes; Android encodes information
about the
user and app IDs into the category set associated with the app data
files in order to enforce user/app isolation while CentOS encodes
information about the
container ID into the category set associated with all container files
in order to enforce container isolation. On the host, all files
associated with the container
are labeled with a single type and a per-container category set.
Within the Android container, the files use the full range of types in
the Android policy and
app data files are assigned a category set representing their user/app
ID.  This is just one use case among many.
