If the timestamp/seqno is part of the hashed data, on every call to 
measure IMA will add a new entry in the IMA log. This would fill up the 
IMA log - even when there is no change in the measured data.

To avoid that I keep the last measurement in SELinux and measure only 
when there is a change with the timestamp in the event name.

Yes - you are right.
The appraiser will have to look at the entire IMA log (and the 
corresponding TPM PCR data) to know the above.

Time t0 => State of the system measured
Time tn => State changed and the new state measured
Time tm => State changed again and the new state measured.

Say, the measurement at "Time tn" was an illegal change, the appraiser 
would know.

Looks like the template used is ima-ng which doesn't include the 
measured buffer. Please set template to "ima-buf" in the policy.

For example,
measure func=LSM_STATE template=ima-buf
