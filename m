The BPF LSM never intended to add default callbacks from the very first =
day:


https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20200224171305.GA21886@chromium.org/


But, we went ahead with a "compromise" because were were going to make =
the LSM layer better and tackle this problem with the broader =
enhancements for the LSM layer. Little did I know this would take 4 =
years (and counting...) from then.


If you want to go ahead with this change for other reasons, please feel =
free to. But, I don't want the BPF LSM default callbacks being cited as =
a reason here.
