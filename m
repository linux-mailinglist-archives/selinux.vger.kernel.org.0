No, that wouldn't work. For example: when compiling a
hashtab_search(&policydb->some_hashtab, ...) call (let's assume it's
defined inline already) inside a function that takes policydb as an
argument, the compiler has no way of knowing what functions you
stashed into hash_value and keycmp in some different function, so it
has to load the pointers from memory and call them. It needs to know
what the functions are right there if it is to generate a direct
constant-address call (or inline them). In C you simply can't
associate functions (data) to types. In C++ this would be easily done
with templates, but the kernel isn't written in C++, so you simply
have to get (somewhat) dirty to get efficient code.

How about if I moved all the 4 hashtab types into a common compilation
unit (policydb_tables.[hc]?) and hid the unsafe generic hashtab
building blocks inside the C file? The header would then only expose
struct hashtab and provide specific functions for each type of
hashtab. And each hashtab "subclass" could be a separate type (which
would just wrap struct hashtab in another struct), which would be even
more type safe than the current state. Let me try to put it into a
patch, where it will be easier to see what I mean...

OK, I'll try to make my case on some more realistic benchmark.
