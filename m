[SIDE NOTE: for some reason my mail is acting a bit odd - this got
buried in a folder and didn't bubble up like normal - my apologies on
the delay, I didn't see it until I was checking for patches today.]

Yes, I saw that too but considering that we are about six months away
from python2 going EOL I think it is reasonable to ignore python2 for
upstream work at this point.

My initial reaction was that we should "/usr/bin/env" until I saw that
bit in the Fedora guidelines, which I honestly don't understand.  Does
anyone with a better understanding of cross-distro userspace know why
"/usr/bin/env" is bad?

Fair enough, I'll go ahead and merge it since it does fix a real
problem.  I did make once change to convert the "Fixes: #46" to use
the full URL, e.g. "Fixes: https://github.com..."; I think this helps
provide some necessary context (what if 10yrs from now we aren't on
github, what does "#46" reference?).

This is starting to stretch the topic a bit, but as far as "use
whatever" is concerned, I'd really like to see us keep moving towards
a more distro agnostic approach when it comes to upstream
development/testing/etc.  While SELinux has always had a "special"
relationship with Fedora/RH, we've seen SELinux grow quite a bit over
the years and I think it would be good to start trying to bring other
distros up to the same level as Fedora when it comes to SELinux
support.  I think one easy first step is to start looking beyond the
Fedora guidelines and see what other distros do/recommend.
