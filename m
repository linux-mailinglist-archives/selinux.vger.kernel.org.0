FWIW, it is likely that this will end up growing in the future to
support stacking LSMs.  It's unfortunate, messy, and generally ugly,
but inevitable.

See the selinux_inode() function as a similar example using
inode/inode_security_struct.

The problem is that in both selinux_socket_create() and
selinux_socket_post_create() the credentials from @current are needed
to determine the sock/sk_security_stuct label.  In
selinux_socket_create() @current's credentials are also used to
determine if the socket can be created.

It's looking like doing labeling determinations in the
security_sk_alloc() struct is not going to work.  While
sk_clone_lock() will end up calling into
security_sk_clone()/selinux_sk_clone_security() via sock_copy(), if I
understand you correctly that won't help as the main MPTCP socket is
not yet setup (e.g. selinux_socket_post_create() has not yet been run
on the main socket).

I generally take the long term view when it comes to Linux Kernel
development; given the nature of the kernel, and all the constraints
that come with it, I would much rather pursue solutions that we
believe have the longest staying power.

I'm also happy to work on, and/or review, LSM patches in conjunction
with a MPTCP refactor.  If the only reason to split the work over two
kernel releases is to soften the blow during the merge window, I think
we can work that out in a single release ... at least I say that now
:)

Basically when it comes down to it, I want to make sure that any fix
we come up with *works*.  In my mind that means doing the LSM fix in
conjunction with the rework; I would hate to see all of the rework
happen only to find out later that it still didn't solve the LSM
problem.

Does that make sense?

I would need to go back through that to make sure that it makes sense,
and ensure that the hook is idempotent for SELinux, AppArmor, and
Smack (current hook implementations), *aaaand* if we promise that this
is just a *temporary* hack I think I would be okay with that.
