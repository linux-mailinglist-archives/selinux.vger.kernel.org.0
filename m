I'm happy to hear that the tests are still running, but we must be
looking at different test results ;)

Great, thank you.

That's good news.  I assume CKI has some provision for emailing people
when there are test failures?  I don't really need to see every
-stable kernel test, but it might be nice to see the failures.
Alternatively, now that I think about it, this shouldn't be that hard
to setup with the secnext stuff ...

That's another good point.  At this point in time I think it is
relatively safe to stick with systemd/systemctl (and skip if systemctl
is not found) as systemd appears to be eating the world; although this
doesn't help with the service name problem.
