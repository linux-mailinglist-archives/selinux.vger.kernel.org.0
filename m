The target object.

If you search for "EXECMOD" in security/selinux/hooks.c in the latest 
(Linux-5.2) master, you'll find only one occurrence - at line 3702.

The logic over there, if translated into English, basically says 
FILE__EXECMOD is required (on the backing file) if mprotect() is called 
to request X on a private file mapping that has been modified by the 
calling process. That's what Sean meant by "W->X".

EXCLAVE_EXECDIRTY is similar to EXECMOD but because of his "maximal 
protection" model, LSM couldn't distinguish between "W->X" and "X->W", 
hence those two are collapsed into a single case - WX in "maximal 
protection".

Correct.

ENCLAVE_EXECANON basically means the calling process doesn't care what 
permissions given to enclave pages as the SIGSTRUCT alone is considered 
sufficient validation. This has a security impact process wide so shall 
be a process permission.

ENCLAVE_{EXECDIRTY|MAPWX} express enclave specific 
requirements/behaviors and IMO shall be enclave permissions, probably 
manifested as file permissions on the file containing SIGSTRUCT. Sean 
was taking a shortcut to make them process scope in order to avoid 
keeping the SIGSTRUCT file around, which was what I criticized as 
"illogical".
