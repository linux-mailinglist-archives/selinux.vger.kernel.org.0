My objection is to the fact that it's implicit.  I have no problem
with some operation succeeding if the source address is X and failing
if it's !X, but I don't think it's fantastic to have it succeed in
either case but do different things.

For what it's worth, while this is a bit of a theoretical issue for X,
but I think it's a real problem with W.  To avoid accidentally mapping
an enclave page X and then later mapping the same page W (potentially
in a different VMA), I think it will be a lot simpler if the driver
can track which pages are allowed to ever be W.  We definitely *don't*
want an interface in which the eventual writability of a page is
inferred from the W permission on the source address, since we do
*not* want to force anyone to map their enclave file PROT_WRITE or
even to open it O_RDWR.

With the explicit MAXPERM passed in, this issue goes away.  You can
specify W if you want W.

That's exactly what I intended here.  If you specify MAXPERM=3DRX, then
the kernel can validate that the source address is executable.

How to do mmap(RX) if FILE__EXECUTE is *not* granted for /dev/sgx/enclave, =
even if MAXPERM=3DRX?

I think we just let /dev/sgx/enclave be FILE__EXECUTE.  We don't
*have* to make it so that FILE__WRITE and FILE__EXECUTE on
/dev/sgx/enclave means you can create RWX enclave mappings.

Hmm.  I guess we either use FILE__WRITE and FILE__EXECUTE or we use ioctl()=

If the driver works like that, then whatever call sets up this lazily
allocated heap could do the MAXPERM part.

That being said, is the performance advantage from putting this logic
in the kernel instead of in the untrusted part of the SDK really
worthwhile?

I think this is a non-starter :(  FILE__WRITE also means that you can
write to the file, and the admin / policy author will almost never
want to allow that.
