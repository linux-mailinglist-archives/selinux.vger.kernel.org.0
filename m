Given that it's used as a string and just compared whether it's same, I
guess it would be ok to change it. ssh uses a similar format for
fingerprint - SHA256:vEJndgoJKp27dZKD/R1i34ViA6Fn3VfOB6UjmWIQD5g - so it
makes sense.

To make it simple for users, it would be great if `semodule` provides
posibility to show a checksum also for module files, e.g. users would just
compare output of `semodule --checksum --show ./module.pp` and `semodule
--checksum --show module.pp` Some time ago I started to work `--show`
but haven't finished it yet.
