What's the impact on distros/ecosystems if we go with #1 for now and later
decide to switch to #2 after upstreaming?  I.e. can we take a minimal-ish
approach now without painting ourselves into a corner?

We can map quite closely to the existing intent of EXECUTE, EXECMOD and
EXECMEM via a combination of checking protections at enclave load time and
again at mmap()/mprotect(), e.g.:

#ifdef CONFIG_INTEL_SGX
static inline int enclave_has_perm(u32 sid, u32 requested)
{
	return avc_has_perm(&selinux_state, sid, sid,
			    SECCLASS_PROCESS, requested, NULL);
}

static int selinux_enclave_map(unsigned long prot)
{
	const struct cred *cred = current_cred();
	u32 sid = cred_sid(cred);

	if ((prot & PROT_EXEC) && (prot & PROT_WRITE))
		return enclave_has_perm(sid, PROCESS__EXECMEM);

	return 0;
}

static int selinux_enclave_load(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long prot)
{
	const struct cred *cred = current_cred();
	u32 sid = cred_sid(cred);
	int ret;

	/* Only executable enclave pages are restricted in any way. */
	if (!(prot & PROT_EXEC))
		return 0;

	if (!vma->vm_file || IS_PRIVATE(file_inode(vma->vm_file))) {
		ret = enclave_has_perm(sid, PROCESS__EXECMEM);
	} else {
		ret = file_has_perm(cred, vma->vm_file, FILE__EXECUTE);
		if (ret)
			goto out;

		/*
		 * Load code from a modified private mapping or from a file
		 * with the ability to do W->X within the enclave.
		 */
		if (vma->anon_vma || (prot & PROT_WRITE))
			ret = file_has_perm(cred, vma->vm_file,
					    FILE__EXECMOD);
	}

out:
	return ret;
}
#endif
