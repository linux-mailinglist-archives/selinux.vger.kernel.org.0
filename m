I remembered that systemd once tried using SCM_SECURITY but that was a
bug since systemd was using it with stream sockets and that wasn't
supported by the kernel at the time,
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1224211, so systemd
switched over to using SO_PEERSEC.  Subsequently I did fix
SCM_SECURITY to work with stream sockets via kernel commit
37a9a8df8ce9de6ea73349c9ac8bdf6ba4ec4f70 but SO_PEERSEC is still
preferred.  Looking around, I see that there is still one usage of
SCM_SECURITY in systemd-journald but it doesn't seem to be required
(if provided, journald will pass the label along but nothing seems to
depend on it AFAICT).  In any event, I don't believe this patch is
needed to support stacking AppArmor.
