The SELinux state and policy would be measured but the AppArmor
state/policy would be silently ignored. This isn't ideal as the IMA
policy author would need to read the kernel code to figure out which
LSMs are going to be measured.

In addition to SELINUX_STATE and SELINUX_POLICY, we should also consider
the proposed LSM_STATE and LSM_POLICY func values but require an "lsm"
rule conditional.

So the current proposed rules:

 measure func=LSM_STATE
 measure func=LSM_POLICY

Would become:

 measure func=LSM_STATE lsm=selinux
 measure func=LSM_POLICY lsm=selinux

The following rules would be rejected:

 measure func=LSM_STATE
 measure func=LSM_POLICY
 measure func=LSM_STATE lsm=apparmor
 measure func=LSM_POLICY lsm=smack

Of course, the apparmor and smack rules could/would be allowed when
proper support is in place.
