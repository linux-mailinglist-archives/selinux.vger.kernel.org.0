Thanks.  My hope is that we can continue to grow/refine as we go along.

I just noticed that a few weeks ago too.  I took a look at the
documentation (there isn't much) and it looks like I should be able to
mark/set the "checks" using pwclient; I'll need to do some extra work
to filter out the non-kernel patches but that shouldn't be too hard.
For a while now I've had hopes to automatically run each posted
patchset through a full build/test cycle similar to what happens with
kernel-secnext and updates to the XXX/next branches, and getting it
working with the sanity tests above is a good first step towards
making that happen.

> Perhaps you could even reuse some of the tooling/infra they use.

As far as tooling/infrastructure is concerned, I've got my own hacky
little setup that I started putting together back when I started the
kernel-secnext automated builds/testing, I'd just assume use that as
it is already in place and works well for my needs.  I can post a link
to the tooling I use if anyone is interested, but I'm not sure I would
recommend anyone use it ;)

Thanks for the input and the suggestions.

I'm not sure I have the time/patience to do this on a per-function
level across all of security/selinux, but I understand your point
about breaking it up to allow for easier cherry-picking.  Let me see
what I can do.

I'm not sure if there is a clang-format config setting for that, but
if I'm honest I kinda prefer it without the alignment.  If you can
find a clang-format config that would preserve the alignment without
affecting anything else we can consider it, but I might pull a
"maintainer's prerogative" card on that ;)
