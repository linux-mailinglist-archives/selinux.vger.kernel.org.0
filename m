I, too, would like to see it gone, but removing it immediately would
likely cause issues for existing users (see [1]). So considering the
removal is going to take some time, I'd prefer to at least stop the
kernel from crashing in the meantime.

I do plan to seriously look at removing the runtime disable entirely,
but that is a longer-term goal. Restoring the logical hook order would
be trivial once the removal is done.
