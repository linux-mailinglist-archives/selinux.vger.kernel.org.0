Thank you.  While Fedora, and RH, likely care most about the latest
stable Fedora release, the Rawhide results are the most interesting
from an upstream perspective.

I've mentioned this before and I feel like this is a good time to
stress this point again - I think it is very important to work on
becoming less Fedora/RH centric.  I recognize that this might be a bit
of a learning curve for most of us as we try to get up to speed with
different distros and packaging formats (the latter is a pain point
I'm currently working through with Debian's dpkg), but I think this is
an important part of helping to increase SELinux adoption.
