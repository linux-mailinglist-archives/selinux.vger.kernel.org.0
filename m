I'm looking at how to enable LSMs to selectively turn on audit 
collection. So there seems to be two key points: audit_alloc() and 
__audit_syscall_entry(). Would it suffice to define a single boolean 
hook that takes the task and call it from both functions, to decide 
whether to override an AUDIT_DISABLED state in audit_alloc() and to 
override a 0 audit_n_rules in __audit_syscall_entry(). In audit_alloc() 
if audit_filter_task() returned AUDIT_DISABLED and the hook returned 
true, we would change the state to AUDIT_BUILD_CONTEXT. In 
__audit_syscall_entry(), if the hook returned true, we would set dummy 
to 0. Obviously, we could have a more general hook which lets us return 
arbitrary audit states, but, it isn't clear how we would reconcile 
conflicting results from audit_filter_task() and the hook for any 
situation other than AUDIT_DISABLED. We could also potentially use a 
different hook in __audit_syscall_entry(), though I don't think that we 
want the LSMs trying to interpret the syscall number or arguments.

Do you think that is sufficiently general or would you suggest something 
different?
