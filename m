As I'm looking at this, I'm wondering why we don't just bail out early
if the policy isn't loaded?  The context lookup and permission checks
later in the function are pretty much useless if the policy hasn't
been loaded (they are just going to return defaults/allow), I think
the only thing we would need to check would be
inode_owner_or_capable().

  int selinux_inode_setxattr(...)
  {

    if (strcmp(name, XATTR_NAME_SELINUX)) {
      ...
    }

    if (!selinux_state.initialized)
      return (inode_owner_or_capable(inode) ? 0 : -EPERM);

    if (sbsec & SBLABEL_MNT)
      ...

    if (!inode_owner_or_capable(inode)
      ...

    ...
  }
