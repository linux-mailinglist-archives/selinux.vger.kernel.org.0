You should probably consider to remove bachradsusi account from Github
SELinuxProject org and remove them commit rights. They provided
https://github.com/bachradsusi.gpg with public keys they can't confirm
that private keys are really in hands of Petr:

E853C1848B0185CF42864DF363A8AD4B982C4373 - uses SHA1 and private keys
are lost - according to me, so it would be better to contact Petr with
encrypted message and ask him to sign a response. But it could take some
time to get a response for him.

68D21823342A13683AEB3E4EFB4C685B5DC1C13E - not signed by any SELinux
team member.

There's a risk that they'll change released files and files signatures.

Petr
