That assumes the patch(set) is merged and not applied directly from
email, patchwork, etc.  I try not to make too many assumptions about
how patches end up in various trees as everyone/every-tree is a bit
different; including the details in a commit description has been the
safest route in my experience.  Regardless, the key is that info gets
into the git log in a way that is easily discoverable, the exact
mechanism is less important as far as I'm concerned.

> Paul, please stop being so difficult and let's fix this.

David, please look at the associated threads and see that we *are*
working on fixing this; no one likes broken code, we all want this
fixed.  As far as being difficult is concerned, I can assure that from
my perspective the individual who merged a patchset in less than 24
hours (during the initial days of the merge window) without an ACK
from the affected maintainers and then refused to revert the patches
when asked is the difficult party, but I guess we all have our
different opinions.

Best wishes and warmest regards.
