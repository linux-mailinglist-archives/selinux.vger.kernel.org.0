Looks like I sent you a snapshot with a couple of minor porting errors before I
fixed them. You can still look at the patches since the errors do not change
the logic, just hold off on compiling. Apologies for the mix-up, I'll send out
another version soon.

Just wanted to provide some additional background so we can better understand
each other. I focus primarily on real-time aspects of the system, so pretty
much everything I write here has to be viewed in that context. For example,
while I would like to get average performance numbers improved, I am much more
concerned with extreme outliers. Such frame of thinking, to some degree, could
be considered similar to the primary reason why Linux prefers heapsort over
quicksort: while quicksort is faster on average, it also suffers from a
pathological worst-case scenario of O(n^2).

I understand that real-time Linux is a small niche. However, I do believe that
at least some of the changes I suggest would be useful to general public also.
Although I would be really happy if my patches were to get accepted, I think
of them more as conversation starters rather than actual finished product.

I've got a Fedora 32 beta box installed, so I will get some benchmark numbers
for Linus' tree with default F32 policies soon.

I get that. My point is that some of the inefficiencies (at least from my
standpoint) had been in the kernel for a long time and are still there today.
As much as I'd love to get our clients off ancient release, they have their
own reasons to use it, thus fixing my point of reference to something old.

Sure. My point is that hardcoded sizing is inconvenient so it would be nice
to fix it in some way. Moving stuff into Kconfig was the easiest way to do
it in my case, but I am open to better suggestions.

Correct. However, old hash reliably produces about 40% collision rate while
a new one has distribution which is demonstrably better and it gets even more
so with liarger number of buckets (which, admittedly, is not necessarily what
a typical end-user would use).

I am not an expert on SELinux (be that kernel or usersace side of business),
so I make do whith what is readily available to me: whatever comes with
the distribuition by default (meaning Targeted policy from CentOS), or
whatever a client is willing to provide us (if anything at all). Further,
as our client had discovered issues under particular workload, that is the
one I am using to benchmark my fixes. That said, I am willing to run a
better test suite if you have one ready.

Here is my take on it: proper hash functions are just as hard to come up
with as locking and encryption schemes. Please consider following three points:

1. In 2006 Thomas Gleixner discovered that standard known-good hash_64()
is actually not that good. A very interesting discussion followed:
https://lwn.net/Articles/687494/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20160428163525.495514517@linutronix.de/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20160430205235.24232.qmail@ns.horizon.com/

2. A simple custom hash had already been deemed inadequate and replaced in
avtab.c with (unfortunately) a custom version of known good generic hash:
commit 33ebc1932a07efd8728975750409741940334489
Author: John Brooks <john.brooks@jolla.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 24 16:54:17 2015 -0400

3. We already have at least three ways to do essentially the same thing:

/* _OLD_ AVTab hash - see point #2 above */
static inline int avtab_hash(struct avtab_key *keyp, u32 mask)
{
       return ((keyp->target_class + (keyp->target_type << 2) +
                (keyp->source_type << 9)) & mask);
}

static u32 rangetr_hash(struct hashtab *h, const void *k)
{
        const struct range_trans *key = k;

        return (key->source_type + (key->target_type << 3) +
                (key->target_class << 5)) & (h->size - 1);
}

static inline int avc_hash(u32 ssid, u32 tsid, u16 tclass)
{
        return (ssid ^ (tsid<<2) ^ (tclass<<4)) & (AVC_CACHE_SLOTS - 1);
}

Yet another local copy of a simple custom hash is already being suggested for
future use in SELinux:

+static u32 role_trans_hash(struct hashtab *h, const void *k)
+{
+	const struct role_trans_key *key = k;
+
+	return (key->role + (key->type << 3) + (key->tclass << 5)) &
+		(h->size - 1);
+}

https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/20200407182858.1149087-1-omosnace@redhat.com/

So, as a kernel developer looking at SELinux for the first time in attempt to
resolve a real issue for a real custoer, I have the following questions:
- Why do we need so many ways to hash 3x 32-bit values?
- Why avtab hash was deemed to be bad, but not the other ones? Was it due to
unfortunate chice of shift constants?
- Why avc hash is using XOR while rangetr is using addition? Why shift (2, 4)
vs (3, 5)?
- Why not just use known-good jhash_3words() everywhere and be done with it?

Thank you for making time for this. I'll get you some numbers.
I really hope a better Linux for everyone will come out of this.

Thank you!
