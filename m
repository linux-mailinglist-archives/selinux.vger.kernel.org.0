You and Stephen have obviously spent more time looking at this than I
have, but looking it over this morning it seems reasonable.

I still can't say I'm really loving the write lock side of this, but
short of breaking the boundary between the security server and the
Linux/LSM hook side of the code I'm not sure there is a really good
solution.  I think simply commenting it as Stephen has done is about
the best we can do.

It is my opinion that passing an arbitrary mutex into the security
server code doesn't really accomplish much.  Sure, it gives the caller
some indication that exclusivity is required, but a bare mutex doesn't
really provide any guarantee that the *right* mutex is being used.  If
we wanted to fix that we would need to look at passing down the
selinux_fs_info pointer itself, but then we are back to breaking the
abstraction between the security server and the Linux hook layer.  The
only thing saving us here is that this code is *deep* inside SELinux
and it is *extremely* unlikely that we are going to have any
cross-subsystem abuse which touches this code.  The comment based
approach isn't perfect, but I think it is our best option at this
point in time.

I'll differ :)

I realize multiple assignments look pretty cool in that
hey-I-can-combine-three-lines-of-code-into-one sorta way, but I hate
having to read code like that, especially when you get to that point
where you end up reading more code than you write.

Simple code is easier to read, easier to review, easier to debug, and
easier to maintain.

... and just to be clear, combining multiple assignments on a single
line in combination with a ternary statement is not my idea of
"simple" ;)

Merged into selinux/next, thanks everyone.
