As mentioned in the other thread, CRIU can work with read access to
map_files.

I will send out a v2 with a renamed capability soon and also include
map_files to be readable with that capability.

The two things are setting a PID via ns_last_pid/clone3() and reading
map_files.

Also in this thread Kamil mentioned that they also need calling prctl
with PR_SET_MM during restore in their production setup.

I will prepare a new version of this patch using CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
for ns_last_pid/clone3(), map_files, and prctl with PR_SET_MM.
