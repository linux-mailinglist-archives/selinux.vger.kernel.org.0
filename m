We already have a /proc/$PID/attr directory for LSM-related process attribu=
tes.
Simple enough to add a new attribute there if we want it to be
general/applicable to other
LSMs. That interface only allows a task to modify its own attributes
(see proc_pid_attr_write);
I assume that suffices here?  Other attributes set that way (e.g.
fscreate / create_sid) are similarly
inherited across fork and unconditionally reset on execve.

Currently in the case of SELinux those attribute values are stored in
the cred security blob, which
used to be the task security blob (hence the legacy
task_security_struct name) before creds existed.
Later LSM revived support for a separate task security blob for the
sake of TOMOYO so that does exist
if needed but SELinux doesn't currently allocate or use it. AppArmor
switched to using it for its task-specific
state after it was restored; SELinux could split its current
task_security_struct into two parts (per-cred and
per-task) and do likewise if that is worthwhile (not sure).

With respect to the implementation, it is generally frowned upon to
embed SELinux-specific fields and code
in the core kernel (versus wrapping in a LSM security field and hooks)
and I think most if not all of what
you want is achievable through existing security fields and hooks once
you add a new attribute to /proc/pid/attr.
