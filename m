Are you talking about moving EMA somewhere outside LSM? If so, where?

I'm afraid you have misunderstood the code. What is kept open and gets 
closed in selinux_file_free() is the sigstruct file. SELinux uses it to 
determine the page permissions for enclave pages from anonymous sources. 
It is a policy choice made inside SELinux and has nothing to do with EMA.

There's indeed an ema_file_free_security() to free the EMA map for 
enclaves being closed. EMA does *NOT* rely on any other LSMs to free 
data for it. The only exception is when an LSM fails enclave_load(), it 
has to call ema_remove_range() to remove the range being added, which 
was *not* required originally in v2.

Just trying to match file names as "capability" uses commoncap.c.

Like I said, this feature could potentially be used by TEEs other than 
SGX. For now, SGX is the only user so it is tied to CONFIG_INTEL_SGX. I 
can rename it to ema.c or enclave.c. Do you have a preference?

Then why is commoncap.c located in this directory? I'm just trying to 
match the existing convention.

There is one indeed - ema_file_free_security().

Will change.

Will add.
