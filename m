True and I like to be clear about this upfront that from what I can tell
now I wouldnt mind refusing re-declaration of block and macro *IF* we
can reliably use "in" consistently and that is currently not the case.

Allowing re-declaration of macros does give more flexibility because it
allows you to re-define whole macros as opposed to in-statements only allowing
you to append to existing macros, but that limitation would be something
I could live with.

The thing is that for me its more important the "in" works reliably in
the longer run. I mean even if I would be allowed to re-declare macros
that then still would not allow be to re-declare blocks and I would like
to have the ability to append to existing blocks.

Yes it is useful but I believe that "in" statements should work
consistently regardless simply because it is not intuitive that you can
only insert into containers that were not declared using templates.

One should be able to insert into containers regardless of how they were
constructed IMHO.

Maybe, but I think that regardless this should just have worked. Would
you not agree? Are there unsurmountable technical difficulties?

That seems unintuitive to me. I mean you can properly inherit blocks
with all bells and whistless as long as the block does not inherit. If
it inherits then bets are off. That seems inconsistent.

Yes sure theres alway's a hack and if all else fails then I guess I will
have to explore my options, but it feels wrong.
