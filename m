Ah ha!  That would definitely explain why I didn't see it in my test
runs, I generally don't do anything on the test system when the test
is running.

I just updated the selinux/dev branch with the change from Al's tree.
Considering the minor nature of the fix, and the other patches
currently in flight on the list, I just updated the original commit
(with a note) and did a force push; I doubt that will cause issues
with anyone, but as I try to avoid force pushes on the */dev branches
I thought it was worth mentioning.

Thanks everyone!
