Given that and the conversations to date, the open question may be
whether there needs to be a common 'LSM namespace' infrastructure at
all or just punt everything to LSM's that choose to implement
namespaces.

No argument that any task could call for separation.

We seem to be dancing around the notion that the primary use, nee
demand, for a security namespace will be to allow container specific
security policies.  In that scenario, the resource orchestrator or
container runtime will be what is requesting a specific security
model to be implemented in a namespace.

At least for model based LSM's, the configuration needs to occur
before execution within the namespace begins in order to avoid
possible races with respect to the security policy that gets effected.

Casey advocates for the use of lsm_set_self_attr(2), which has the
advantage of a common API and is probably sufficient if an LSM elects
to provide a generic management interface.

The system call is currently not namespace aware so the challenge will
be how to direct the configuration payload to the correct namespace.

Given that limitation, it seems highly probably that individual LSM's
will implement configuration/policy management via their various
pseudo-filesystem implementations that will grow awareness for the
namespace context that the commands are being issued for.

This approach seems contrary to what Casey is advocating for in our
conversations, but perhaps we misunderstand what he is saying.

Casey indicated that no other LSM should be able to deny the ability
of another LSM to create a namespace.

As we noted in our exchange with him, this seems to violate the
current LSM model where all of the LSM's need to agree that an event
should be allowed, or it fails.

See above, the open question seems to be whether or not there is
agreement that any LSM can generically deny the creation of namespace
creation.

Again, we may misunderstand Casey on this issue.

Again, the issue is making this system call namespace aware.

It would seem the most straight forward path is to simply punt this to
the LSM's itself.  If nothing else, it reduces the issues that
everyone needs to agree on.

Again, allow both at the discretion of the LSM.

We will find that current namespace semantics are challenging with
respect to being a good model for LSM namespaces.

Current namespaces focus on managing a single resource.  In contrast,
as we have seen in our discussions, an 'LSM namespace' involves
multiple resources, each with their own specific requirements.  On top
of that we have the complication of 'stacking' where anything that
happens will be the composite of what all the LSM's agree on, some of
which may be in the root namespace and some of which may be in
subordinate namespaces.

The notion of a process entering a security namespace, aka setns, will
be interesting.  It would seem that this will require callbacks to
every LSM that is participating in the namespace.  Presumably all of
the references to LSM security contexts will need to be suspended and
replaced with references to the context(s) for the security namespace
that is being entered.

With respect to managing this effectively, we would advocate for a
64-bit global counter that gets incremented on each successful LSM
namespace creation event.  That would provide a unique handle for the
namespace that will never wrap.

What we are talking about here is the need to support a process
requesting to run in an alternate LSM namespace without forking.

The question of whether this should be allowed will be regulated by
whatever composite security policy is operational, the same as would
be the case with the switch on fork model.

Once again, that seems inconsistent with what Casey is advocating.

Although I'm sure he is happy that a new capability bit is not in the
offing... :-)

I think we are talking past one another.

Configuration was perhaps a poor choice of vernacular, we were
referring to policy or model load.

As we mentioned in our exchange with Casey, the expection for all of
this from the user community will be to allow resource orchestrators
to run a workload under the constraints of a specific security policy.

Where policy should be probably plural.

Stephen even notes this on the slides that are linked from his GitHub
selinuxns site.

Given that the concept of LSM stacking is overlaid on top of
namespaces, the result of all this will be security policies that will
be very interesting to reason about, particularly if multiple levels
of namespacing are allowed.

The other issue will be potential performance issues for LSM's that
choose to chase permissions all the way back up to the root namespace.
We've heard continuous suggestions that every pointer de-reference
is problematic from a performance perspective.

So, lots of issues to consider in all of this.

Have a good weekend.
