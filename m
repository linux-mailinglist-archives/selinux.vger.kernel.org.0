Hi Stephen,

Thanks for the quick reply.

Apologies, I lost track of GFP_ATOMIC when I reading the code and didn't
think it was propagated down to all of the potential allocations and
string functions. Having looked at it again, I can't see where it blocks.

Might be worth a comment in avc_compute_av(), because the temporary
dropping of rcu_read_lock() looks really dodgy when we could be running
on the RCU path walk path anyway.
