I'll do that, thanks! I'll also loop in kernel-hardening folks.

Yes I understand -- I view this as an auxiliary feature that helps 
maintainers in their duties, but certainly doesn't aim to replace due 
diligence. I am most worried about the following scenario:

1. a maintainer receives a long series of patches that arrives into 
   their inbox
2. they carefully review the patches and decide to merge them
3. they use "b4 am" to grab that patch series from lore.kernel.org
4. however, the archive has been manipulated and returns patches 
   containing malicious edits, which get merged because the maintainer 
   assumes that what "b4 am" returns is the same as what they reviewed

Cryptographic attestations helps hedge against this scenario by removing 
any implicit trust from the centralized system like lore.kernel.org (or 
patchwork.kernel.org, for that matter).

All good, this is why I'm casting the net wide looking for initial 
adopters. :)

Best regards,
