Pushed up a further commit to the branch on my fork of systemd to have
it call the SELinux setup + init functions if invoked from
systemd-nspawn with the SELinux namespace unshared. The existing
systemd was skipping setup/init of all of the MAC modules if running
in a container, which was understandable absent namespace support. My
current patch (just to allow further progress) only relaxes that
constraint for SELinux and only if launched via systemd-nspawn with
the --selinux-namespace option; this would of course be generalized
further if/when we get around to upstreaming it. With that change and
installing the modified systemd into the container root filesystem, I
can start a container via systemd-nspawn with the --selinux-namespace
option and have it unshare the SELinux namespace, load policy from the
container's root, and set its enforcing mode. At present, if the
container is configured to be enforcing, the container will fail due
to denials in the child SELinux namespace arising from the following:
- systemd creates a regular tmpfs mount for the container /dev, so at
least some of the /dev nodes are not correctly labeled at startup.
This can likely be fixed through some combination of policy and
perhaps performing a restorecon("/dev") after first loading policy.
- Certain /proc/sys files in the container are labeled with
"unlabeled_t" for some reason, likely due to being accessed n the
namespace before it loads a policy and not getting initialized
afterward. Similarly could be fixed via a restorecon("/proc") after
policy load if we can't solve it kernel-side.
- sendto permission denied from kernel_t and from init_t to
unconfined_t:unix_dgram_socket; this is likely the container sending
to a socket in the parent namespace.

There are no doubt more beyond these. However, in permissive (with the
parent/init namespace still enforcing), the container did come up
fully and sees SELinux as enabled.
