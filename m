Theirs a lot of features that rely on particular cflags, consider hardening
options. A lot of the warnings/error stuff is not just a code hygiene, but =
also
spotting potential issues that could arise as security issues. If one start=
s
tinkering with cflags, you can really change the code quite a bit. This is =
why
some places only approve sanctioned builds of crypto libraries.

But one of the things to consider is that for clang builds, clang
doesn't support
this option, so we would need to move the compiler checking code into each
projects root makefile and ensure any consuming subordinate leafs add a
default, or move it to the global makefile and make sure each leaf that nee=
ds it
has a default.
