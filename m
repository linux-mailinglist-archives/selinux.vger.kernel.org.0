I don't think there is ever a clear answer when you have a patch(set)
that crosses subsystem boundaries, there is always going to be a bit
of awkwardness and merge-fun for those affected.  If something touches
SELinux, and this patch qualifies as far as I'm concerned, I tend to
offer to take it via the SELinux tree (mostly for selfish reasons as
it helps with merge conflicts) unless James wants to pull it via the
LSM tree; in almost all of those cases James has deferred the changes
to the SELinux tree.  In this particular case I guess I didn't
explicitly ask about the LSM tree vs the SELinux tree, but the patch
has been on-list for weeks and it wasn't snatched up so I felt like
pulling it into the SELinux tree was justified.  If nothing else,
between the SELinux, audit, and netlabel changes I guess I can claim
some level of merge authority ;)

However, regardless of this particular patchset, I agree that the LSM
stacking patches should almost surely go in via the LSM tree.
