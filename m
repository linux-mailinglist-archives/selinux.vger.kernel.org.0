IMHO that's not a good plan.  Consider for example what happens if you
allow a domain to override MLS constraints (ala mlstrustedsubject) and
you don't enforce TE at all.  Then what prevents a untrusted process
running at the same level from ptrace'ing that trusted domain in order
to bypass MLS, or overwriting its exec type with arbitrary code, or
any number of other things that could be used to subvert it.  That
only works if you are willing to rely entirely on DAC separation for
that kind of protection.  That's more along the lines of Smack's
model.

From an implementation point of view, it would be easy enough to
modify context_struct_compute_av() to just initialize the allowed
access vector to all-ones instead of zero, drop the nested ebitmap
loop for computing over the TE rules, and then walk the constraints
(which include the MLS constraints as a subset) to remove any
permissions that violate the MLS restrictions.  Essentially
context_struct_compute_av() reduces to just the constraint logic in
your scenario and the rest of the function can go away.  But that
leaves you open to the problem noted above.  At that point you might
as well just use Smack if that does what you need.  But understand
then that you are relying on capabilities and DAC as external
dependencies, so correct configuration and use of those is crucial and
not something under Smack's control.
