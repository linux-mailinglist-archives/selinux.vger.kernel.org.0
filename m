I would suggest using FILE__RELABELFROM instead, under the raionale
that a process that is allowed to set security.sehash would also be
allowed to set security.selinux.  In contrast, a process might be
alowed to set another attribute (FILE__SETATTR) but not
security.selinux or security.sehash.

Correct.

I'd be willing to move from requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN to performing a
SELinux permission check (either FILE__RELABELFROM or a new one), but
I'd like the Android folks to chime in here.  Maybe you can ping them
through other channels since they haven't responded yet.
