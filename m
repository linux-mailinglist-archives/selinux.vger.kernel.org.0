tcpd would have to grow selinux awareness and do that manually using the
setsockcreate() functionality provided by libselinux.

systemd does this with its socket activation functionality.

selinuxproject.org documents almost the full policy language (the docs
there arent maintained all that well)

Another great documentation is:
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/tree/master/secilc/docs
This is for the CIL, but can be useful nonetheless to give an idea of
the possibilities.

Some aspects that are interesting:

transitions: manual, automatic and dynamic
role based access control: user role, role type and role allow rules
policy constraints
attributes vs. identifiers
security classes and access vector permissions (access vectors)
