I misread. I also think the I might be overlooking use-case but the main
point I would like to make is that with a volatile root / is empty
except that there is a readonly /usr mounted. With that said I don't see
how using /var would be an solution.

systemd-tmpfiles and systemd-sysusers run very early to populate the
filesystem from /usr/share/factory and to create users. Both of them
rely on a working libselinux. Hence the chicken and egg.
