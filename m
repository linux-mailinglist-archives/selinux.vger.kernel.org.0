All right, I'm going to call your bluff here - who are these people
running AppArmor on the host and SELinux in a container?  What policy
are they using, it's surely not an unmodified Fedora/RHEL or upstream
refpol policy?  Do they run in enforcing mode without massive
permissions granted to kernel_t (I'm guessing all of the host
applications would appear as kernel_t)?  How do you handle multiple
SELinux containers?

I'm aware of *one* use case where SELinux is run in a container and
that required a number of careful constraints on the use case and a
good deal of hacking to enable.  I'm sure there are definitely people
that *want* this, especially in the context of Ubuntu, but I really
doubt this is in widespread use today.

See my earlier comment to John.  I care a lot about getting things
right, and very little about how long it takes.  I'm sympathetic about
the time and difficulty involved, but I see that as no reason to merge
a not-good design.

Ha!  Let's just agree to disagree on that point :)
