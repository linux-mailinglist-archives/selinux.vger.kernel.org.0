I am so used to everything just using the stuff in
include/sepol/policydb/ that I forget that it exists. There are a
number of iterators there (for users, ports, nodes, etc), so it seems
like creating an iterator and other functions for filename transition
rules and converting setools to use that would be the first step. Over
time other iterators can be created and setools converted to use those
as well.
