This looks like a nice step forward. Are you also looking into
integrating these checks into patchwork? I noticed that e.g. in the
netdev project patches get tagged with similar sanity checks (netdev)
and even test results (bpf). Perhaps you could even reuse some of the
tooling/infra they use.

Regarding the impact on backports: yes, this will be potentially
*very* painful for us (Red Hat engineering), depending on how it's
done. What would help is if you could split the change into many small
commits - ideally something close to per-function (with some closely
related functions/declarations/definitions maybe combined together). I
know it would be a lot of commits and a non-trivial amount of extra
work, but from a consumer's perspective I don't really see any
downsides vs. a single big commit. From a pure upstream perspective I
definitely support the change, so hopefully we can come to a
compromise such that we are both happy with the result :)

As for the proposed style, it looks mostly good to me. One minor
concern I have is that it removes some visually helpful alignment
after '=3D'/':' in selinux_sb_clone_mnt_opts(), selinux_syslog(),
selinux_fs_parameters, and selinux_nf_ops. Not something I would lose
sleep over, but would be nice if it can be somehow preserved.
