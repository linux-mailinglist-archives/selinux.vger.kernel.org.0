> +The SELinux Userspace Security Vulnerability Handling Process
> +===============================================================================
> +https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux
> +
> +This document attempts to describe the processes through which sensitive
> +security relevant bugs can be responsibly disclosed to the SELinux userspace
> +project and how the project maintainers should handle these reports. Just like
> +the other SELinux userspace process documents, this document should be treated
> +as a guiding document and not a hard, unyielding set of regulations; the bug
> +reporters and project maintainers are encouraged to work together to address
> +the issues as best they can, in a manner which works best for all parties
> +involved.
> +
> +### Reporting Problems
> +
> +For serious problems or security vulnerabilities in the SELinux kernel code
> +please refer to the SELinux Kernel Subsystem Security Policy in the link below:
> +
> +* https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel/blob/main/SECURITY.md
> +
> +Problems with the SELinux userspace that are not suitable for immediate public
> +disclosure should be emailed to the current SELinux userspace maintainers, the
> +list is below. We typically request at most a 90 day time period to address
> +the issue before it is made public, but we will make every effort to address
> +the issue as quickly as possible and shorten the disclosure window.

> +### Resolving Sensitive Security Issues
> +
> +Upon disclosure of a bug, the maintainers should work together to investigate
> +the problem and decide on a solution. In order to prevent an early disclosure
> +of the problem, those working on the solution should do so privately and
> +outside of the traditional SELinux userspace development practices. One
> +possible solution to this is to leverage the GitHub "Security" functionality to
> +create a private development fork that can be shared among the maintainers, and
> +optionally the reporter. A placeholder GitHub issue may be created, but details
> +should remain extremely limited until such time as the problem has been fixed
> +and responsibly disclosed. If a CVE, or other tag, has been assigned to the
> +problem, the GitHub issue title should include the vulnerability tag once the
> +problem has been disclosed.
> +
> +### Public Disclosure
> +
> +Whenever possible, responsible reporting and patching practices should be
> +followed, including notification to the linux-distros and oss-security mailing
> +lists.
