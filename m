We're trying to be good with capabilities, basically locking it down
until we trip over one of them and then think about it and enable it
where appropriate;  the difficulty is that capabilities are only a bit
better than root; they're still fairly granular - like in this case
where you're pushed towards a wide ranging CAP even though you only
want to give the user a trivial extra thing.
(We have a similar problem wanting to allow separate threads to
be in separate directories, but that requires unshare and that requires
another capability)

Not only this, but the label that is running virtiofsd pretty much has to run as unconfined, since it could be writing any SELinux label.

Why exactly?
IMHO the biggest problem is it's badly defined when you want to actually
share filesystems between guests or between guests and the host.

Right, it's namespaces that we've used in most places to give ourselves
the isolation.

I doubt we're the only case that wants a way to do xattr separation; you
get lots of weird cases where it pops up (e.g. stacked overlayfs)
