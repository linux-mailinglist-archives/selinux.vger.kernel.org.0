Thanks for your patience and your continued work on this Richard.  I'm
testing out the new patchset now and hope to be able to report back
soon, i.e. tonight assuming no interruptions.

As far as Kindles and the various ebook formats go, the reason I
mentioned the Kindle is simply because it seems to be one of the most
popular ebook hardware devices and as such I figure it would be
important that The Notebook render correctly there.  However, I'm well
outside the realm of my expertise, so if anyone can correct me, please
do so :)

It has been my experience, and I'm assuming that of most Linux/SELinux
folks, that if I'm reading something on a proper computer that needs
more formatting than what plaintext can provide a PDF is preferable.
Is it common for people to choose ebooks over PDFs when reading on a
larger computer screen?
