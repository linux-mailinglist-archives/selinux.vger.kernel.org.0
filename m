Yup, I compiled the list in "brainstom-mode", trying to include
whatever would be possible even if clearly not suitable.

Thanks, I did not consider such possibility!

I think we should be careful to avoid increasing sk_security_struct
size. Currently it is 16 bytes, nicely matching a kmalloc slab, any
increase will move it on kmalloc-32 bytes slab possibly causing
performance and memory regressions).

More importantly, I think there is a problem with the 
sk_clone_lock() -> sk_prot_alloc() -> security_sk_alloc()
code path. 

sk_clone_lock() happens in BH context, if security_transition_sid()
needs process context that would be a problem - quickly skimming the
code it does not look so, I need to double check.

sk_clone_lock() is in a very critical path - socket creation for
incoming connections. The sid-related operation there will be
unnecessary/discarded by later the selinux_inet_csk_clone(), this will
likelly cause performance regressions even for plain TCP sockets.

Perhaps the cleanest option could be the one involving the mptcp
refactoring, moving subflow creation at a later stage. It could have
some minor side benefit for MPTCP, too - solving:

https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/290

but I'm not fond of that option because it will require quite a bit of
time: we need first to have the mptcp refactor in place and then cook
the lsm patches. I guess such process will require at least 2 release
cycles, due to the needed mptcp(netdev)/lsm trees synchronization.

If that would prove to be the most reasonable option, could we consider
to transiently merge first something alike:

https://lore.kernel.org/mptcp/CAHC9VhSQnhH3UL4gqzu+YiA1Q3YyLLCv88gLJOvw-0+uw5Lvkw@mail.gmail.com/T/#m06c612f84f6b6fe759e670573b2c8092df71607b

to have a workable short-term solution, and later revert it when the
final solution would be in place?

Thanks,

Paolo
