Exactly, plus we pick up a little more test coverage on the userspace bits
by swapping out what's installed in the VM with the current build and running
the tests. The speed is less important, it's just fast enough where our CI isn't
going to take years to complete. CI doesn't need to be super snappy per se,
but it also cannot take a fortnight.
