Without passing any judgement on the patches Ondrej submitted (I tend
to ignore patches as attachments for various reasons), I do share
Ondrej's concerns that this may not be as simple as suggested in the
original patch in this thread.  I saw the same thing as Ondrej
regarding the TCP fallback and that immediately raised a number of
questions that I don't believe have been properly addressed yet.

Someone needs to dig into how the standard SMC protocol works first to
ensure we have the necessary access controls for the current code; my
guess is that we are probably okay since the socket-level controls are
fairly generic, but I'm not sure we've actually seen proper
confirmation that everything is good from a conceptual standpoint.
Once that is done, we need to examine how the TCP fallback works,
specifically how are connections managed and are the existing TCP
hooks sufficient for SMC (the early connection state stuff can be
tricky) and how to distinguish between normal-TCP and SMC-TCP.

Basically I'm looking for some basic design concepts and not simply a
passing test without any understanding of why/how it passed.
