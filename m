In the first patch we hade premission that was in the format:

permission={read !write open}

That would have work fine if it was not for that the permission can be created
dynamically.Â  It would be very easy to change that to

permission=read permission=!write permission=open

But I think that will cause problems too. The create a format specifiaction
in the trace tree, and I dont think we can describe this format.

Yes. But Im arguing that we still have the same information,
but it will "cost" that we have more events. It is a fair trade-off,
it is usually a lot better to have the trace simple than
flexible and let it cost events when needed.

No. It can filter on strings. But it can not do any fuzzy matching.
They are equal not not equal. So if you have a parameter value
that is { open read !write } you need to specify a exact match.

With multiple events you match for "open" or "write" not "{ open read !write }".

So you get one event for "open" and a other event for "write".

The numeric values is not matching perm=, it is a match for the
bits in the denied= parameter that is present within selinux_audited event.
