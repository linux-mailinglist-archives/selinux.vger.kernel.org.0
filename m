It does survive repeated load_policy (as well as semodule -d/semodule -e,
with expected effect on /booleans, AFAICS).  As for the testsuite...
No regressions compared to clean -rc5, but then there are (identical)
failures on both - "Failed 8/76 test programs. 88/1046 subtests failed."
Incomplete defconfig, at a guess...
