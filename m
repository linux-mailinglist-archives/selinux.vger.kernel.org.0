I've given this a bit more thought, and I'm actually leaning toward
your option #1, Stephen.

Doing away with netlink threads (for non-fallback) should be fine. The
only real change in functionality would be handling of status events
on the next access check, rather than immediately in the thread.

I have a patch repaired to use this approach (and properly handle avc
threads for the sestatus fallback case). I just need to
rebase/review/re-test before submitting.

Thanks for all of the feedback and sorry for the delay.
