Re-based again on latest selinux/dev, and pushed a few more changes:
- selinux: make open_perms namespace-aware; demonstrates how to
integrate the namespace-based checking with the open_perms policy
capability so that we only check file open permission in namespaces
that enable the capability in their policy. That was the easy case;
the rest of the policy capabilities are less clear on how to resolve
as per my earlier description.
-   selinux: split cred_ssid_has_perm() into two cases; alters how the
namespace-based checking is applied to socket and SysV IPC checks
based on some testing
-  selinux: set initial SID context for init to "kernel" in global SID
table; fixes what would be a userspace compatibility problem for init
in child namespaces by duplicating what we were already doing in the
security server's per-policy SID table.

In addition to running the testsuite in a child SELinux namespace as
before, I also launched a RHEL9 UBI container, manually unshared the
SELinux namespace in a shell within it, and loaded the RHEL9 policy
into the child namespace to simulate what we would ultimately want the
container runtime to do. That motivated the latter two changes above.
Not quite ready to put that into enforcing mode due to some denials
between container processes and host resources (like the inherited
open fds) but a step forward.
I think to better understand what else is needed, it would help to
prototype modifications to a container runtime to unshare the SELinux
namespace (just using the current /sys/fs/selinux/unshare interface
for now) before launching the container init, and see if the container
init does the right thing (i.e. concludes that SELinux doesn't yet
have a policy loaded based on /proc/self/attr/current=3D=3D"kernel",
mounts its own /sys/fs/selinux private to its namespace, and loads its
policy into it). Thoughts on what the easiest container runtime to
patch in this way would be, or anyone want to try?
