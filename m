Fedora packager point of view:

From time to time, Fedora project decides to use new/different flags for
different reasons. In order to make it easier for packagers there are Fedor=
a
distribution macros available which can be used in .spec files and which se=
t all
needed flags, e.g:

$ grep CFLAGS libsepol.spec =20
make %{?_smp_mflags} CFLAGS=3D"%{optflags}" LDFLAGS=3D"%{?__global_ldflags}=
"

$ rpm --eval 'make %{?_smp_mflags} CFLAGS=3D"%{optflags}" LDFLAGS=3D"%{?__g=
lobal_ldflags}"'          =20
make -j4 CFLAGS=3D"-O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=3Dformat-security -Wp,-D_FORT=

There's a simpler way using %set_build_flags in .spec file:

$ rpm --eval '%set_build_flags'                                            =
                          =20

From this POV it would be great to have -fno-semantic-interposition in CFLA=
GS
override in libsepol Makefile.

But given the compatibility problem described in this thread, I, as Fedora
packager, would consider as sufficient to have this requirement in the buil=
d instructions in
documentation, and also as part of new release notes as it's changed in the=
 latest release.
