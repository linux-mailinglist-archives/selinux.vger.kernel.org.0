I confirm this fixes the issue reported in
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=36466&q=selinux&can=2
which can be reproduced by the following policy:

(macro MACRO ())
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
(in MACRO (blockinherit BLOCK)) (call MACRO)
...
repeated at least 4000 times
