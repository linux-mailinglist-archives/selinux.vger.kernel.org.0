Policy or model load, specific to the subordinate namespace, will be
a necessity.

As Casey noted, some LSM namespaces will require configuration and
management calls well after the namespace has started.  Other LSM's
will want the configuration to be completed before the namespace
starts, with any further configurations to the namespace blocked.

There is a very valid security rationale for isolating the capability
for namespace separation from the capability that allows the
configuration of a security model.  It would be an entirely realistic
security objective for a namespace to block further separation
attempts, while still allowing for management operations to be
conducted in the context of the subordinate namespace.

Hence the rationale for splitting CAP_MAC_ADMIN from whatever name the
bike shedding process around the new capability naming process
produces.

Policy load needs to be atomic with respect to namespace separation.
In other words, the policy needs to be in place when execution within
the context of the new security namespace begins.

A resource orchestrator will need the ability to load the new policy
that will be enforced into the context of the new namespace.

In the case of some model/integrity based LSM's, the security events
related to the policy load need to occur in the context of the parent
LSM namespace.

See the writings of Werner Karl Heisenberg for the reasoning behind
that... :-)

We will respond more directly to the issue of clone, unshare and
external process entry, in the other thread where you initiated a
discussion of these issues.  We believe there is a strong argument to
be made that LSM namespace separation is a poor fit for the classic
fork/unshare model of the other resource namespaces.

Among other issues, a direct separation model places the complexity of
policy verification and loading in userspace.  As was noted above,
accounting for the security events related to the policy verification
and load process, in the orchestrator process, will be a requirement
for some integrity and functional models.

Have a good weekend.

As always,
