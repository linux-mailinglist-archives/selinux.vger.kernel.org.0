No. You are misunderstanding. This problem is not limited to out-of-tree and/or
loadable LSM modules. This change prevents new LSM modules from getting upstream
due to a chicken-and-egg problem.

Currently anyone can start writing new LSM modules using name as identifier. But
you are trying to forbid using name as identifier, and trying to force using integer
as identifier, but that integer will not be provided unless new LSM modules get
upstream.

Then, how those who want to write new LSM modules can start writing LSM modules and
propose userspace changes for new LSM modules? They can't use the identifier unless
their LSM module get upstream, which in turn forces them not to propose interface for
userspace programs, which in turn makes it difficult to get new LSM modules tested
by users, which in turn makes it difficult to get upstream due to "who is using your
LSM module" question, which in turn makes it difficult to get the identifier...

You are trying to force CONFIG_MODULES=n by just "we don't care about out-of-tree code".
Trying to change identifier from name to integer is a serious bug.
