Hi,

I was reading this pull request [1] and looked into how I might be able
to implement this in policy but there seem to be some technical
difficulties.

* I already use getfscon to seperate the systemd user.slice because the
  system manager delegates the user.slice to the user manager.

  (genfscon "cgroup2" "/user.slice" cgroupfile_context)

  In the past the proved to be a racy where systemd attempts to
  write before the object has the context associated with the genfscon.
  I decided to dontaudit attempts to write to the mislabeled object and
  it *seems* as if systemd retries until it can write it i.e. when the
  object carries the expected label and so that seems to work eventually
  but it looks fragile.

* The challenge with memory pressure implementation [2] is that these
  "memory.pressure" files end up in random locations under
  "/system.slice" for example:

  /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/systemd-journald.service/memory.pressure

  Where in the above systemd-journald.service might be
  templated (systemd-journald@FOO.service). Point is that the path is
  random. genfscon does not support regex and glob. I can't do for example:

  (genfscon "cgroup2" "/system.slice/.*/memory.pressure"
  cgroupfile_context)

  Fortunately cgroup2fs supports relabeling but if systemd has to
  manually relabel the cgroup files then I would imagine that this is
  racy as well, and that does not really solve the underlying issue.

  I am looking for ideas and suggestions
