Speaking for myself here. I want to be able to clarify as much as
possible, without having to resort to: "this is added because of some
kernel internal", because those aspects distract when you try to learn
how to write a policy from scratch. Things tend to stick better when
you understand their purpose.

The situation is improving though. I don't think we were able to write
a policy by just being aware of this "process transition" internal in
the recent past. The lifting of the classordering make it possible to
start with just "process transition" and then get all the classes and
perms from dmesg as you go without having to be aware of all the
classes and perms needed (let alone any ordering as now you can just
all unorder it)

Another path in this picture is the ability to omit unused isids, It
just does not help trying to explain "were just adding these sids and
sidcons due to some kernel internals" Now we can just stick to used
sidcons and explain why they are needed.

So aside from the "process transition" secret sauce, I think the only
other aspect that might be hard to explain are the sidorder and the
need for sidorder.

But other than the above now writing a policy from scratch is just
easier. Thanks for that.
