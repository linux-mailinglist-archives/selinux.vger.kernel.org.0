OK to summarize EXECMOD does not connect with SGX in any possible way
but SGX needs something that mimics EXECMOD behaviour?

And the same probably goes for EXECMEM, which is also private mapping
related concept.

Right.

Right.

Yeah, that has been the confusing part for me that they've been shuffled
in the discussion together with SGX concepts and hooks like there was
any connection. Thank you for clarifying this!
