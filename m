I don't really have much personal experience with the kernel tracing
tools, so an example would be helpful as I'm not really following what
you are saying.  Are you talking about something like
"permission=foo,bar,baz"?

I think we've all come to the conclusion that doing the permission
bitmap-to-string translation in a plugin is not really desirable.

Oh, wait, is the issue that the tracing subsystem can't filter on
strings?  That doesn't seem right, but I can understand why one might
want to avoid that for performance reasons.  If the tracing subsystem
*can* filter on strings, why did you say that in the "perm=foo
perm=bar" format one would need to filter on numeric values?  I still
think I'm missing something here ...
