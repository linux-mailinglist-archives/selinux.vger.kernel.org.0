I've made a pass at this and force-pushed it to my
working-selinuxns-rebase branch.
It turned out that the first patch did two things: it renamed state to
ns and it changed all direct references to &selinux_state to use a new
current_selinux_state pointer to a static init_selinux_state variable
(in preparation for multiple states/namespaces).  I had to retain the
latter so I just dropped the renaming part of it, rewrote the
description, and did a mass rename in all the subsequent patches back
to state. So the first patch may still produce some conflicts but
there should be fewer of them.  This is relative to your current next
branch but it will need to be manually re-based again when/if the
policy rcu patches land, so feel free to wait if you want.  Since
every patch required modification and many of them required manual
fixups, I dropped all of your Signed-off-by lines and rewrote all of
mine with my current preferred email address.
