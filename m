In this we disagree ....

The label follows the lsm name directly. What other association is required?

I grant that. But the purpose of the format is to present LSM/context
pairs. What other information would make sense? We could add an "aux"
field, but that seems somewhat arbitrary.

There was a lot of discussion regarding that. My proposed
apparmor="unconfined",smack="User" format was panned for those same reasons.
The nil byte format has been used elsewhere and suggested for that reason.

True, but it uses pointers internally and you can't do that in memory
you're sending up from the system. What comes from the syscall has to
look something like the nil byte format. The strawman would have to do
the same sort of parsing in userspace that you are objecting to.

Can you describe potential flags or additional data? Planning for the future
is a good idea, but throwing fields on "just in case" seems contrary to
what I'm used to hearing from you.
