I think so but it has been a long time. Presumably I needed more
modules than come with the stock RHEL MLS policy.

They might not be true but I used an object class that doesn't have
defaults set in any policy that I've seen in public. I suppose another
tool to validate the assumption could be written.

Easily fixed, obviously I didn't know range c0 c1023 was valid in
sensitivitycategory statements. Pretty nice actually.

I suppose that should be added.

I'm not currently set up to re-test this but could fix it up next week.
