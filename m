That's good to hear, I know it is going to be difficult, but I think
we can all agree it's the right thing to do.  Any idea when you might
have a better idea of the time involved?

Next week I think I'm going to put together a RFC patch that marks
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE as deprecated, and displays a warning
when it is used at runtime.  Later on when we have a better idea of
the removal date, we can start adding delays when it is used to help
get people to migrate to the cmdline approach.
