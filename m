I understand that and I'm not proposing the revert as a long-term fix.
For a long-term solution I propose using kernel_write() and extending
it to allow the caller to suppress (just) the
security_file_permission() call. Then each caller would have to decide
whether the LSM check makes sense in that situation or not. It seems
safer against future mistakes than leaving it up to the caller to call
security_file_permission() explicitly (I predict that no new user
would even realize that the call might be needed).

The difference is not in security, but in usability. The kernel
communicating with the autofs daemon is an internal detail that
shouldn't need special rules in policy. Even if we want to do any LSM
checking here, the subject should be kernel_t, not the current running
process. The process doesn't have any control on whether the kernel
does the communication and it doesn't control the content of the
communication, so the permission check as it is doesn't make any
sense. People writing the policy should be burdened by low-level
details about how the kernel works internally as little as possible.

As I said above, I think Stephen's approach is less future-proof. And
it seems that rw_verify_area() has many other callers, most/all of
which probably service actual requests from userspace and we'd need to
retain the security_file_permission() call in those cases.

Let me try to put my proposal into a patch, so we have something
concrete to talk about...
