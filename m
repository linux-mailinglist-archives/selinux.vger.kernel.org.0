Thanks, will do. As an aside I tagged this RFC because I first wanted to
get some feedback on the main idea.

Yes I am aware of this issue (i have that addressed in the way to
described above, and you also covered that in the notebook)

However, for the sake of simplicity I wanted to address it like this:

1. The xwayland issue is a bug IMHO, and even though it can be "worked
around" with these hacks. I feel that is not worth it. Also the xwayland
coredumping, AFAIK, happens when you exit xwayland (in this scenario).

2. Xserver itself will do the right thing with the
/etc/selinux/TYPE/contexts/x_contexts (ie, it will not be able to parse
it and therefore it will disable XACE, so the desired result with the
benefit that the file was reused to document it a little)

3. xwayland should be pretty niche by now.

But if you insist, then, if I decide to upgrade this RFC to PATCH, i
guess I will address it. (but I would prefer to address it as either a
note in the README or in a separate README, not as part of the cil
because I really want to have as little noise/distractions as possible
in there.
