I just pushed up another change on top of my working-selinuxns branch
that fixes this issue albeit inefficiently memory-wise.
For the moment, it saves the security context in the inode security
blob when inode_doinit_with_dentry() first obtains it via getxattr(),
and later re-uses that context in the !may_sleep case. Ultimately we
will want to re-do this using an approach similar to Smack so that we
don't keep multiple copies of the same security context in memory.
This change combined with adding further calls to
__inode_security_revalidate() to the file*has_perm() prior to
accessing the inode security blob (now that we can safely do so)
eliminates the problem I was seeing with sshd, although I am sure
there remain other cases.
Next issue to address is the open fds when you unshare the namespace.
