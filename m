Thanks for the double check.  Unfortunately my kernel build locks my
test VM in early boot; it appears to be non-SELinux related and since
the test build is based on selinux/next+patches (which is based off
v5.4-rc1) I imagine there might be some unrelated problems in the
build.  I'm going to rebase my test build to Linus' current and try
this again.

Like I said, I only quickly scanned the combined diff for style
problems so it doesn't surprise me that there are still some issues.
I'll give it a closer look once I can get a kernel build passing all
the tests.

As an aside, I keep debating doing a big style-fix patch (likely
automated via astyle or similar, likely with some additional fixes by
hand, and passed through checkpatch.pl) after one of the -rc1 rebases
to clean up all these little things that have crept into the code over
the years.  I dislike the idea of the churn that would likely bring,
but it should make life a little bit better, and help cut down on the
trivial "checkpatch patches" we get from time to time (although that
really hasn't been too bad of an issue).
