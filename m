I have done more further testing.

I could not reproduce it on another VM on the same hardware.

I could not reproduce it on the same VM after a reboot of the physical 
hardware (running Debian/Unstable with KVM).

After the reboot I could not reproduce it on saved snapshots of the VM in 
question dating back to when I had previously had problems.  I conclude that 
rebooting the hardware solved the problem.

The problem was either an issue of failing hardware (I am running memtest86+ 
right now) or hostile action.  When testing for issues with libsepol I got a 
couple of coredumps from valgrind, that isn't necessarily an indication of 
anything (valgrind is complex software and it provides information on how to 
report bugs when it crashes so crashes of valgrind aren't unexpected).  I also 
got one coredump from sshd which is very unexpected, sshd is known to be high 
quality software that is well written and well audited.  This makes me wonder 
whether there is some commonality between sshd and semodule that causes both 
of them to have had problems on the system in question.  For background the 
sshd coredump info is below.

I ran the spectre-meltdown-checker script, it says that the physical hardware 
in question is vulnerable to the following (there doesn't seem to be microcode 
updates for the Q9505 CPU to fix all the issues):

CVE-2018-3640 aka 'Variant 3a, rogue system register read'
* CPU microcode mitigates the vulnerability:  NO 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (an up-to-date CPU microcode is needed to mitigate this 
vulnerability)

CVE-2018-3639 aka 'Variant 4, speculative store bypass'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable)
* Kernel supports disabling speculative store bypass (SSB):  YES  (found in /
proc/self/status)
* SSB mitigation is enabled and active:  NO 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (Your CPU doesn't support SSBD)

CVE-2018-12126 aka 'Fallout, microarchitectural store buffer data sampling 
(MSBDS)'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable: Clear CPU 
buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT disabled)
* Kernel supports using MD_CLEAR mitigation:  YES  (found md_clear 
implementation evidence in kernel image)
* Kernel mitigation is enabled and active:  NO 
* SMT is either mitigated or disabled:  YES 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (Your kernel supports mitigation, but your CPU 
microcode also needs to be updated to mitigate the vulnerability)

CVE-2018-12130 aka 'ZombieLoad, microarchitectural fill buffer data sampling 
(MFBDS)'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable: Clear CPU 
buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT disabled)
* Kernel supports using MD_CLEAR mitigation:  YES  (found md_clear 
implementation evidence in kernel image)
* Kernel mitigation is enabled and active:  NO 
* SMT is either mitigated or disabled:  YES 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (Your kernel supports mitigation, but your CPU 
microcode also needs to be updated to mitigate the vulnerability)

CVE-2018-12127 aka 'RIDL, microarchitectural load port data sampling (MLPDS)'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable: Clear CPU 
buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT disabled)
* Kernel supports using MD_CLEAR mitigation:  YES  (found md_clear 
implementation evidence in kernel image)

* SMT is either mitigated or disabled:  YES 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (Your kernel supports mitigation, but your CPU

CVE-2019-11091 aka 'RIDL, microarchitectural data sampling uncacheable memory 
(MDSUM)'
* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable: Clear CPU 
buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT disabled)
* Kernel supports using MD_CLEAR mitigation:  YES  (found md_clear

Given that the system is vulnerable to certain known attacks and that sshd is 
a prime target for any such attack I believe that the sshd SEGV is an 
indication that the root cause might have been hostile action.  I don't expect 
to ever have proof of what was the cause (unless memtest86+ flags an error).  
When hostile activity goes away on reboot then something memory resident is 
likely in which case there's probably no record on disk.

I am convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that the SEGVs and valgrind 
warnings I saw from semodule were not evidence of a bug in libsepol.
