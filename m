Okay, maybe not that shortly. I tried your suggestion and dbus doesn't
appear to receive the netlink messages.

Initially I figured it had something to do with
avc_create_thread(avc_netlink_loop) call still being in
avc_init_internal, so I exposed the thread pointer in avc_internal.h
and moved the call into avc_netlink_open, which seemed more
appropriate. Still no dice.

I'm probably doing something wrong -- I'll figure it out, but it's
going to take me longer than I thought to track this down.
