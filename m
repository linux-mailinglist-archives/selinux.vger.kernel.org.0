So what is going on here is that type t is being declared and that is
completely different from the string t that is a macro parameter.
The allow rule resolves because t is a valid type. As the macro is
written, the "yolo" being passed in is not used. But if you would make
a named type transition rule that takes t as the filename, it would
end up with "yolo".

An error would be produced if you had used (type t) instead of (string
t) in the macro.
There probably should be a warning in the case above.
