Likely because it's based on the SELinux next branch with the
checkreqprot removal patch added on top as I expect to merge both of
these patches soon.  There have also been some pretty widespread
changes in the SELinux tree this dev cycle outside these two
deprecation/removal patches.

One could make an argument that this should go in via the LSM tree as
it touches all of the LSMs, but those impacts are trivial, and the
SELinux changes are more significant so I made the decision to do the
development and merge the patch via the SELinux tree.
