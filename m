Interestingly, the test program is working fine:
https://github.com/mpalmi/selinux/tree/sestatus
https://github.com/mpalmi/sestatus-test

On a test run, I'm seeing both the status page and netlink socket
notifications for load_polcy (twice for each case):

```
 ./test
opened avc successfully
got netlink socket: 4

watching netlink socket for events
avc:  received policyload notice (seqno=3)
policy reload notice received
avc:  received policyload notice (seqno=4)
policy reload notice received
^C
watching sestatus page for events
avc:  received policyload notice (seqno=5)
policy reload notice received
avc:  received policyload notice (seqno=6)
policy reload notice received
^Cclosing netlink socket: 4
destroying avc
goodbye
```

Still seeing the MAC_POLICY_LOAD audit message, but none of the usual
USER_AVC policyload notices.

I'm not certain if I've covered enough, but this is where things
currently stand. I can submit another patch to the list if that's
preferable. I just figured I'd keep the noise down as much as possible
until we figure out what's going on with dbus.

Thanks for all the help
