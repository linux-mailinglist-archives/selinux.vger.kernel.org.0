I don't think the SIDs are useful because they are dynamically
assigned (aside from the initial SIDs for bootstrapping before policy
load) and are not exported to userspace (userspace has no way to look
them up).  It is probably a mistake that we even fall back to logging
them in the existing code and may just be a legacy of when SIDs were
exported to userspace (ancient history, before mainline merge of
SELinux).

In any event, if you were to include the sample usage and output I
provided as part of the commit message / patch description (or replace
with your own example), that would be helpful I think.  Even better
would be to also provide some hint as to how people are expected to
decode the requested/denied/audited fields (I know how to do that but
not everyone will, and ideally one would have a script or something
for doing so).
