Based on Ondrej's comments in this thread it sounded as if there was
some renewed interest in actually eliminating it from Fedora this
time.  If that's not the case, perhaps it's time to start that effort
back up, and if we can't ever get away from the runtime disable then
we can take the step of admitting that everything is terrible and we
can consider some of the options presented in this thread.
