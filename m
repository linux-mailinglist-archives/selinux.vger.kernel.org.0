Thank you, that's very nice of you to say, but Richard Haines and the
other Notebook contributors are the ones who deserve the credit (check
the git log, not everyone adds their name to the copyright page!).
Richard was kind enough to put together The SELinux Notebook in the
first place and offer it under a public license; my role thus far has
simply been to post it to GitHub on behalf of Richard, do some minor
cleanup, tweak the HTML/PDF CSS a bit, and merge patches as they hit
the list.

The SELinux project is very fortunate to have a good sized community
with a number of contributors, and I'm very happy to say we've made
some big improvements to documentation and testing over the past few
years.

I've long wanted to start doing regular testing of the bleeding edge
kernel bits (the "kernel-secnext" testing) on Debian as well as
Fedora.  While Fedora has been an excellent "home" for SELinux
development, I think it is important that we strive to bring that same
SELinux experience to other distros too.  Debian seemed to be an
obvious next choice to me, and while the kernel-secnext testing is
only a small part of that I'm hopeful it will have a positive impact
on the effort ... when I get some time to do that of course :/

We're all in different boats, and I think that's a good thing :)

If you find any problems, or have some text that you think would be a
nice addition, patches are always welcome :)
