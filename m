Can you suggest what should be passed into security_ismaclabel()?
Typically this is driven by a call into the kernel module that
registered an xattr_handler and LSM passes into it an attribute name
to use to lookup (basically what is passed into the xatrr_handler for
key/name is passed to security_ismaclabel()). VFS readdir doesn't have
anything like that.
