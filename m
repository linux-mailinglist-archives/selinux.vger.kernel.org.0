Outside of the SGX subsystem, the kernel is unaware of EPC memory, e.g.
BIOS enumerates it as reserved memory in the e820 tables, or not at all.

On current hardware, EPC is backed by system memory, but it's protected
by a range registers (and other stuff) and can't be accessed directly
except when the CPU is in "enclave mode", i.e. executing an enclave in
CPL3.  To execute an enclave it must first be built, and because EPC
memory can't be written outside of enclave mode, the only way to build
the enclave is via dedicated CPL0 ISA, e.g. ENCLS[EADD].

EPC memory is swappable in it's own terms, e.g. pages can be swapped
from EPC to system RAM and vice versa, but again moving pages in and out
of the EPC can only be done through dedicated CPL0 ISA.  And there are
additional TLB flushing requirements, evicted pages need to be refcounted
against the enclave, evicted pages need an anchor in the EPC to ensure
freshness, etc...

Long story short, we decided to manage EPC in the SGX subsystem as a
separate memory pool rather than modify the kernel's MMU to teach it
how to deal with EPC.
