Hello,
I have another question: why is bumping the .so version needed? As we
are not changing the ABI of a "linked symbol" (thanks to using
versioned symbols, with .map files), if we do not bump the .so
version, programs that were built with libsepol.so from years ago will
just stop working due to missing symbols, with an error message which
will be quite clear (and this only if they were using deprecated
symbols). In my humble opinion, bumping the .so version is most
required when the calling convention of a non-versioned symbol
changes, but this leads to unexpected execution paths.

Nevertheless I did not spend time to search for a document that would
explain why bumping the .so version would be recommended when removing
symbols. If you know one, could you please add a reference to it in
the commit description ("Following guidelines from https://...) and/or
to some documentation?

>From a "distro maintainer point of view" (for Arch Linux), having just
spent a considerable amount of time due to breaking changes in the
last release of PAM, I am not eager to spend time dealing with finding
clever ways to smoothly upgrade the system if there is no
easy&straightforward way to do this. Introducing a transition package
for each library which is bumped is acceptable to me, but if the
release after the next one bumps the version again, introducing
another set of transition packages will begin to be quite painful. In
short: I agree to remove the deprecated functions in order to "bump
the .so version only once", as suggested.

Cheers,
Nicolas
