I was a little surprised to see pr_warn_ratelimited() (from both the
KERN_WARNING and ratelimited perspectives) used in the policy loading error
path so I poked around a bit. The description of commit 4262fb51c9f5 ("selinux:
log errors when loading new policy") explains the reasoning:

    If the policy fails to be loaded from userspace then a warning message is
    printed, whereas if a failure occurs after loading policy from userspace an
    error message will be printed with details on where policy loading failed
    (recreating one of /classes/, /policy_capabilities/, /booleans/ in the
    SELinux fs).

This seems like sound logic and would result in Ondrej using pr_err() in the
sel_make_policy_nodes() error path.
