The matched character is a backslash ("\"), not a slash ("/"). I
understand that this implementation of "c++; without fc->str_len++;
nor fc->stem_len++;" is there in order to count sequences such as
"\(", "\.", "\["... as a single character. More precisely, when for
example the two-character sequence "\." is encountered in a path
(which happens often, as it is the way to escape dots in file context
patterns):

* c is increased twice ("c++;" in present twice in the while loop), in
order to go to the character next to the sequence ;
* fc->str_len is increased once (this sequence counts as a single
non-special character) ;
* if fc->meta is false (i.e. if no meta character such as ".", "(",
"["... has been encountered yet), fc->stem_len is increased once (this
sequence counts as a single non-special character in the "stem" of the
path)

The code I added in my patch made fc->stem_len increase when a path
ends with "\" (the character after the backslash character is a NUL
string terminator), before exiting cil_post_fc_fill_data. Now I am
wondering whether fc->str_len should also be increased, in order to
"count the backslash". In fact, finishing a path pattern with an
incomplete escape sequence is weird and I do not precisely know the
semantic of the length counters in such a case. What do you think?
