Subject: [PATCH RFC] selinux: provide __le variables explicitly

While the endiannes is being handled properly sparse was unable to verify
this due to type inconsistency. So introduce an additional __le32
respectively _le64 variable to be passed to le32/64_to_cpu() to allow
sparse to verify proper typing. Note that this patch does not change
the generated binary on little-endian systems - on 32bit powerpc it
does change the binary.

Problem located by an experimental coccinelle script to locate
patters that make sparse unhappy (false positives):

sparse complaints on different architectures fixed by this patch are:

Patch was compile-tested with: x86_64_defconfig,loongson3_defconfig (both
little-endian) and ppc603_defconfig (big-endian).

On little-endian systems the patch has no impact on the generated binary 
(which is expected) but on the 32bit powerpc it does change the binary
which is not expected but since I'm not able to generate the .lst files
in security/selinux/ss/ due to the lack of a Makefile it is not clear
if this is an unexpected side-effect or due only to the introduction of
the additional variables. From my understanding the patch does not change
the program logic so if the code was correct on big-endian systems before
it should still be correct now.

Patch is against 5.1 (localversion-next is next-20190506)
