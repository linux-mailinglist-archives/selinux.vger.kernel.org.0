What I was thinking of was a second, parallel kernel <-> user-space
interface (like the SO_PEERSECLABELS that I suggested) for future/updated
user-space components. SO_PEERSEC would continue to return some
hopefully-backwards-compatible thing, but would be deprecated, because it
cannot fully represent the reality of LSM stacking while remaining
backwards-compatible.

Note that this implicitly relies on echo being a shell builtin, which
is common but not guaranteed (I don't think). It would work in bash or
dash, though.

If apparmor-do-stuff no longer works, and you have to wrap a shell
script around it, isn't that the same amount of user-space breakage as
if apparmor-do-stuff no longer works and you have to install a newer
version that does work? Either way, the sysadmin must take action to
change user-space components. I think the attr/display thing only reduces
the magnitude of the user-space changes required to catch up, and doesn't
eliminate the fact that those changes were needed.

The problem I see here is that if we assume dbus-daemon is a new/updated
program that has set /proc/self/attr/display = "hideous" in order to get
the full stack of labels for its peer processes, then it will be causing
side-effects on its separately-maintained child processes - they will
no longer be able to benefit from the backwards-compatility thing where
/proc/self/attr/display (effectively) defaults to the first LSM that
has labels, because dbus-daemon overrode that (unless dbus-daemon takes
action to reverse it between fork and exec). This partially defeats the
semi-backwards-compatible handling of the existing kernel interfaces.

If dbus-daemon could read SO_PEERSECLABELS instead of SO_PEERSEC and
read /proc/<pid>/attr/current_stack instead of /proc/<pid>/attr/current,
leaving /proc/self/attr/display untouched, then this concern would go away.

Similarly, dbus-daemon can be linked to libselinux and/or libapparmor
(on Debian it's linked to both, even in the non-stackable present,
and the right one for the kernel configuration is chosen at runtime).
If one of those libraries wrote to /proc/self/attr/display, then the rest
of dbus-daemon's main thread and all child processes would implicitly be
getting the result of that - even if dbus-daemon itself had not yet been
updated for stacked LSMs (in which case it cannot be expected to reverse
their action between fork and exec, because it's an older codebase that
doesn't yet know that "big" LSMs can be stacked).

So I think libselinux and libapparmor should be enhanced to use
new kernel interfaces that get the label they want to get (either
just that label, or all the labels), instead of being enhanced to
write /proc/self/attr/display to change the meaning of old kernel
interfaces. Otherwise they can break other code in their process or
their subprocesses.

Consider only SELinux and AppArmor for a moment (I know there are other
"big" LSMs like Smack, but this same reasoning applies to any pair, with
appropriate search-and-replace on their names).

Neither SELinux nor AppArmor: there are no labels, nothing changed.

AppArmor is the only "big" LSM in the stack (Ubuntu): previously,
the label was the AppArmor label; now, if attr/display is not altered,
the label is the one used by the first "big" LSM in the stack, which is
AppArmor. Nothing changed.

SELinux is the only "big" LSM in the stack (Red Hat): same as for AppArmor
being the only "big" LSM in the stack, but with s/AppArmor/SELinux/.

SELinux and AppArmor stacked: this is a situation that could not exist
before, so distro/sysadmin action must have been necessary to make it
happen. However much ambient process state is invented, I don't see any
way to make both SELinux and AppArmor user-space work without modifications:
at least one of them (the one that is second in the stack) has to use new
kernel interfaces, or alter attr/display to change the meaning of the old
kernel interfaces, or something similar, to get the second LSM's labels.
So distro/sysadmin action in user-space is also going to be necessary here
whatever happens - backward compatibility has already been broken, it's
only a question of how intrusive the user-space changes are. Is it really
so much worse if the distro/sysadmin action taken to update user-space
has to take the form of using new kernel interfaces that always do the
same thing, rather than changing the meaning of old kernel interfaces?
