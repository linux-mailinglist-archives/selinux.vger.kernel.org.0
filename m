Could you leave tun->owner unset?

True. I think that would have satisfied the intent of adding the
group check at the time, and would have avoided this situation.

But we indeed cannot retroactively restrict allowed behavior.
As that will break users.

Conversely, it might be that an existing user out there depends on
the prior behavior that only a process that matches both user and
group can use the device. Which might be reason for reverting the
patch entirely.
