Thanks for details about the unconfined_t domain, this is one option.

IMHO: between permissive domain + audit log and unconfined_t, there might
be room for letting each permissive domain decide its own audit logging
strategy. The reasons are:

1> For a system that have many daemons, a lot of those are not actively
worked by devs, relying on tests is not sufficient to discover all possible
legitimate accesses  at runtime, dev won't be comfortable to enable enforced
mode without some bake time in production, this is where permissive + audit log
helps.

2> The set back of "permissive + audit log" is that one daemon might generate
too much log in production, set to unconfined_t is one option, but
then dev revert
the progress made so far with permissive mode.

3> For a system that is on continuous delivery pipeline, during the phase of
development of selinux policy, daemon owner might need permissive + audit log
in testing, but permissive - audit log in production. This is where
the per-domain
audit log can help, it would be even nicer if this can be controlled
at runtime,
similar to sysctl.

Best regards,
Jeff
