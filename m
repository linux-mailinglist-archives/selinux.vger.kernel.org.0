Off the top of my head I can't think of why a LSM would want to look
only at the skb instead of the individual netlink messages.  I suppose
if that ever becomes an issue we could always pass the skb to the hook
along with the nlmsghdr, and the LSM would just need to deal with
being called multiple times for the same skb.  Another option might be
to give the LSM the option of registering one of two hooks for the
netlink_send hook; one type of hook would behave the same as the hook
does now, the other type would be called once for each message in the
skb.  Although this second option seems like a lot of extra complexity
for a questionable advantage, especially since only SELinux is using
the hook at the moment and we can easily change the hook without
breaking things.

It's also worth mentioning that we've always tried to keep the hook
layer (the stuff in security/security.c) relatively thin, but that's a
battle we've been slowly losing over time.  Moving the skb/nlmsghdr
processing into security_netlink_send() seems reasonable given some of
the other hooks.

Regardless, I'll work on something for an upcoming merge window, stay tuned.
