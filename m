I've dropped " - usage of ... " part completely to make it simple

I've applied all your suggestions. The updated version is bellow.

Thanks for the feedback!


RELEASE 202007XX (3.1)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

User-visible changes
--------------------

* selinux/flask.h, selinux/av_permissions.h and sepol/policydb/flask.h were=
 removed

  The flask.h and av_permissions.h header files were deprecated and
  all selinux userspace references to them were removed in
  commit 76913d8adb61b5 ("Deprecate use of flask.h and av_permissions.h.")
  back in 2014 and included in the 20150202 / 2.4 release.
  All userspace object managers should have been updated
  to use the dynamic class/perm mapping support since that time.
  Remove these headers finally to ensure that no users remain and
  that no future uses are ever introduced.

  Use string_to_security_class(3) and string_to_av_perm(3) to map the class=
 and
  permission names to their policy values, or selinux_set_mapping(3) to cre=
ate a
  mapping from class and permission index values used by the application to=
 the
  policy values.

* Removed restrictions in libsepol and checkpolicy that required all declar=
ed
  initial SIDs to be assigned a context.

* Support for new policy capability genfs_seclabel_symlinks

* New `setfiles -E` option - treat conflicting specifications as errors, su=
ch
as where two hardlinks for the same inode have different contexts.

* `restorecond_user.service` - new systemd user service which runs `restore=
cond -u`

* `setsebool -V` reports errors from commit phase

* Improved man pages

* `semanage` uses ipaddress Python module instead of IPy

* matchpathcon related interfaces are deprecated

* selinuxfs is mounted with noexec and nosuid

* the dso wrappers for internal calls were removed and it is now strongly r=
ecommended to CFLAGS with
  `-fno-semantic-interposition`

* `security_compute_user()` was deprecated

* checkpolicy treats invalid characters as an error - might break rare use =
cases (intentionally)

* New `restorecon -x` option which prevents it from crossing file system bo=
undaries.

* Handle `semanage module` in semanage bash completion

* `sepolgen-ifgen` parses a gen_tunable statement as bool

* `semanage` handles getprotobyname() failure case on Debian where /etc/pro=
tocols does not contain an entry for "ipv4"


Packaging-relevant changes
--------------------------

* Setting CFLAGS during the make process will cause the omission of many de=
faults. While the project strives
  to provide a reasonable set of default flags, custom CFLAGS could break t=
he build, or have other undesired
  changes on the build output. Thus, be very careful when setting CFLAGS. C=
FLAGS that are encouraged to be
  set when overriding are:

  - -fno-semantic-interposition for gcc or compilers that do not do this. c=
lang does this by default. clang-10 and up
    will support passing this flag, but ignore it. Previous clang versions =
fail.

* `setup.py` builds can be customized using PYTHON_SETUP_ARGS, e.g. to for
  Debian Python layout use: `make PYTHON_SETUP_ARGS=3D--install-layout=3Dde=
b ...`


Development-relevant changes
----------------------------

* Improved README which was renamed to README.md and converted to markdown.

* Added Travis CI job to run SELinux kernel testsuite on latest Fedora clou=
d image
