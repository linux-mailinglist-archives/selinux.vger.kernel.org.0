We had a number of exchanges regarding LSM namespacing in the thread
that Paul Moore started on this issue:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/CAHC9VhRGMmhxbajwQNfGFy+ZFF1uN=UEBjqQZQ4UBy7yds3eVQ@mail.gmail.com/

The one issue that seemed to achieve universal consensus was that
every LSM was going to have different requirements for namespacing.

At the risk of playing devil's advocate, this seems to raise the
question as to whether or not there is a need to have a common API for
requesting security namespace separation or leave the issue to LSM
specific implementations.

The primary rationale for some modicum of centralized infrastructure
would seem to be to have a system call rather than an LSM specific
pseudo-filesystem interface to control security namespaces.  Since
creating a system call interface is going to lock the API in stone it
would seem that we would want to get this right, or at least as
generic as possibe.

So some comments to that end.

If we use the lsm_set_self_attr(2) system call as our approach, the
namespace separation process needs to be split into two separate
calls.  One to request the creation of a namespace and a second call
to request that the process join the new namespace.

This is required in order to support the ability for an orchestration
process to load a policy or model and have it in place before the new
namespace is allowed to enforce the policy or model.

So we would need something like an LSM_ATTR_UNSHARE_INIT as well as
the LSM_ATTR_UNSHARE attribute.

So the model would be for a process to issue an LSM_ATTR_UNSHARE_INIT
call to create the new security context namespace.  That namespace
context can then be configured through either an LSM specific
pseudo-filesystem interface or alternatively through additional calls
to lsm_set_self_attr(2).

Once the configuration process is complete, the process would be set
free in its new namespace with the LSM_ATTR_UNSHARE attribute.

Separating from a security policy namespace to a new namespace will be
one of the most security sensitive operations that a system can
execute.  As such it has to be gated by some type of security control.

At a minimum this needs to be uid-0 or posession of CAP_MAC_ADMIN.
Given the current LSM concept of stacking, there needs to be an LSM
security hooks assigned, so as to give all of the LSM's an opportunity
to accept or deny the attribute operations.

For example, it would seem entirely reasonable that the lockdown LSM
may want to deny the ability to create any departures from the current
security configuration.

Making this generic for any security namespace will require some
additional plumbing, most notably the ability for any LSM to register
for the ability to receive namespace event notifications.  If we
create new security_task_secns_init() and
security_task_secns_unshare() hooks we could use those as both
notification and security control mechanisms.

So lots of details to discuss but the above should be about the most
generic implementation that can be leveraged by all of the LSM's.

Comments/suggestion welcome.

Have a good remainder of the week.

As always,
