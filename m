Independent of the naming issue discussed above, I want to make it
clear that in general I believe that the dentry is more useful to the
LSMs if for no other reason that it is pretty trivial to go from a
dentry to an inode, whereas the opposite is not true.  Of course there
are cases where the dentry is not always available, or the
connectivity between the dentry and the inode is not yet present.  In
those cases we would obviously need to pass the inode, or both the
inode and the dentry, which gets me to my next point and my motivation
behind bringing all this up once we started down the rathole ...

My main concern is making sure that the LSM hooks are declared in such
a way that they are fairly resistant to misuse; not that I expect any
malice, but I do believe accidental misuse of the hooks is legitimate
concern.  With respect to the various VFS related hooks, one of the
things that has always caught my attention in this respect has been
hooks which pass both a dentry and a inode for the same file.  Of
course there are cases where this will always be necessary, but I hate
to see bad interfaces continued forward simply because "that's the way
we've always done it".

In this particular patch the hook prototype is reasonably well defined
as far as I'm concerned, with no worries of both a dentry and an
inode, so that's good.  I still don't really like the name disconnect
between the function name and the parameter list (inode vs dentry),
but que sera sera; my appetite for argument here is rapidly waning.
