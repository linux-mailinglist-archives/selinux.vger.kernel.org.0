That is what I intended, yes.  My related request was "I would think 
that we'd want to end up in a situation where the kernel is either 
equally restrictive or less restrictive than CIL".  In isolation, my 
opinion is that the 1024 limit is fine, but I've been hoping James would 
chime in about the feasibility of dropping the CIL limit at some point 
to get them in sync.

FWIW we have a few generated type names internally that subjectively 
feel long to humans, but are still under 100 characters.  So 1024 is 
plenty of extra margin in my opinion.
