Now I got your point. It sounds a great idea to me!

But instead of using .sigstruct file, I'd still recommend using file mapping (i.e. SIGSTRUCT needs to reside in executable memory). But then there'll be a hole - a process having FILE__EXECMOD on any file could use that file as a SIGSTRUCT. Probably we'll need a new type in SELinux to label enclave/sigstruct files.

Yes.

I'm with you.

With your proposal only FILE__EXECMOD is needed on /dev/sgx/enclave to launch Graphene enclaves or the like.

Agreed.

I think I've got your idea. You are trying to use permissions on .sigstruct to determine whether EAUG will be available to that specific enclave. Am I right?

I'd tie EAUG to the permissions of /dev/sgx/enclave instead. But why? There are couple of reasons. For one, a SIGSTRUCT identifies the behavior of the enclave, hence the SGX features needed by that enclave. So if an enclave requires EAUG, the .sigstruct has to allow EAUG or the enclave wouldn't work. That means the system admin wouldn't have a choice but to match up what's needed by the enclave. For two, whether to allow, say loading code dynamically into an enclave, depends on whether the host process can tolerate the inherent risk. And that decision is seldom made on individual enclaves but to the host process as a whole. And /dev/sgx/enclave serves that purpose.
