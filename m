These are already gated by existing LSM hooks and capability checks.
They are not allowed on mandatory access control systems unless explicitly
granted.

We evaluated mechanisms for the MAC to reach unprivileged apps.
A number of researchers have published on this as well such as:
https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/reardon

Three "leaks" were identified, two have already been fixed.
-ioctl(SIOCGIFHWADDR). Fixed using finer grained LSM checks
on socket ioctls (similar to this change).
-IPv6 IP addresses. Fixed by no longer including the MAC as part
of the IP address.
-RTM_NEWLINK netlink route messages. The last mole to be whacked.

This seems like an issue inherent with permissions/capabilities. I don=E2=
=80=99t
think we should abandon the concept of permissions because someone
can forget to add a check.  Likewise, if someone adds new code to the
kernel and omits a capable(CAP_NET_*) check, I would expect it to be
fixed like any other bug without the idea of capability checks being tossed
out.

We need to do something because this information is being abused. Any
recommendations? This seemed like the simplest approach, but I can
definitely appreciate that it has downsides.

I could make this really generic by adding a single hook to the end of
sock_msgrecv() which would allow an LSM to modify the message to omit
the MAC address and any other information that we deem as sensitive in the
future. Basically what Casey was suggesting. Thoughts on that approach?

Thanks for your help on this.
