Yes, but...

The problem isn't the call into the filesystem - it's may_lookup()
passing the inode to security modules where we dereference
inode->i_security and assume that it is valid for the life of the
object access being made.

That's my point - if we have a lookup race and the inode is being
destroyed at this point (i.e. I_FREEING is set) inode->i_security
*is not valid* and should not be accessed by *anyone*.

I don't think that is sufficient to avoid races with inode teardown.
The inode can be destroyed between the initial dentry count sequence
sampling and the "done processing, check that the seq count is
unchanged" validation to solidify the path.

We've seen this before with ->get_link fast path that stores the
link name in inode->i_link, and both inode->i_link and ->get_link
are accessed during RCU It is documented as such:

	If the filesystem stores the symlink target in ->i_link, the
        VFS may use it directly without calling ->get_link(); however,
        ->get_link() must still be provided.  ->i_link must not be
        freed until after an RCU grace period.  Writing to ->i_link
        post-iget() time requires a 'release' memory barrier.

XFS doesn't use RCU mode ->get_link or use ->i_link anymore, because
its has a corner case in it's inode life cycle since 2007 where it
can recycle inodes before the RCU grace period expires. It took 15
years for this issue to be noticed, but the fix for this specific
symptom is to not allow the VFS direct access to the underlying
filesystem memory that does not follow VFS inode RCU lifecycle
rules.

There was another symptom of this issue - ->get_link changed (i.e.
went to null) on certain types of inode reuse - and that caused
pathwalk to panic on a NULL pointer. Ian posted this fix for the
issue:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/164180589176.86426.501271559065590169.stgit@mickey.themaw.net/

Which revalidates the dentry sequence number before calling
->get_link(). This clearly demonstrates we cannot rely on the
existing pathwalk dentry sequence number checks to catch an inode
concurrently moving into I_FREEING state and changing/freeing inode
object state concurrently in a way that affects the pathwalk
operation.

My point here is not about XFS - my point is that every object
attached to an inode that is accessed during a RCU pathwalk *must*
follow the same rules as memory attached to inode->i_link. The only
alternative to that (i.e. if we continue to free RCU pathwalk
visible objects in the evict() path) is to prevent pathwalk from
tripping over I_FREEING inodes.

If we decide that every pathwalk accessed object attached to the
inode needs to be RCU freed, then __destroy_inode() is the wrong
place to be freeing them - i_callback() (the call_rcu() inode
freeing callback) is the place to be freeing these objects. At this
point, the subsystems that own the objects don't have to care about
RCU at all - the objects have already gone through the necessary
grace period that makes them safe to be freed immediately.

That's a far better solution than forcing every LSM and FS developer
to have to fully understand how pathwalk and inode lifecycles
interact to get stuff right...

Yup, I never said that's how we should fix the problem.  All I'm
stating is that pathwalk vs I_FREEING is currently not safe and that
I_FREEING is detectable from the pathwalk side. This observation
could help provide a solution, but it's almost certainly not the
solution to the problem...
