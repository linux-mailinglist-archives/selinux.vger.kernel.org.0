Hello,
For information I am currently on holidays with quite limited access
to my mails and will be fully "back with my test machines" on
2021-08-30. In the meantime I can participate in some reviews but I am
not willing to send patches myself. Nevertheless I will try to review
the "libsepol/cil: move the fuzz target and build script to the
selinux repository" patch properly before Wednesday.

For the release, I am currently aware of two possibly-minor issues and
I do not know whether they are tracked somewhere:

1. secil2tree can output wrongly indented blocks. For example
"secil2tree -A resolve secilc/test/policy.cil" currently outputs:

(block test_ba
    (blockinherit ba)
        (roletype test_ba.r test_ba.t)
        (blockabstract z.ba)
    )
    (role test_ba.r)
    (type test_ba.t)
)

The parenthesizing "(blockinherit ba) ... )" is wrong. The
"(blockinherit ba)" could be replaced with a comment indicating that a
blockinherit was expanded.

2. semanage's gettext setup is currently incompatible with Python
3.10. More precisely
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/gettext.html#gettext.install
indicates: "Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version
3.10: The codeset parameter.". When I stumbled upon this issue, it
occured to me that the whole try-except statement in
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/blob/libsemanage-3.2/python/semanage/semanage#L34-L49
could be replaced with "import gettext" (which is a built-in module in
Python 3) and "gettext.install(PROGNAME,
localedir="/usr/share/locale")". Nevertheless I did not find time to
properly test this change, which is why I have not sent patches for it
sooner.

In my opinion, the first issue is not a release-blocker because
"secil2tree -A resolve" is not expected to output a CIL policy which
can be compiled. The second one could be, if we want to support Python
3.10 (which will be released in October) with the 3.3 release.

Thanks,
Nicolas
