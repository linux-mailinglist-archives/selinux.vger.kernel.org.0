I was thinking of something such as (in cil_destroy_blockinherit):

struct cil_list_item *previous = NULL;
cil_list_for_each(item, inherit->block->bi_nodes) {
  node = item->data;
  if (node->data == inherit) {
    if (previous == NULL) {
       inherit->block->bi_nodes->head = item->next;
    } else {
      previous->next = item->next;
    }
    if (item->next == NULL) {
      inherit->block->bi_nodes->tail = previous;
    }
    cil_list_item_destroy(&item, CIL_FALSE);
    break;
  }
  previous = item;
}

This code walks inherit->block->bi_nodes only once, but it would be
less maintainable because it relies on cil_list's implementation
details. So I was thinking of introducing a new helper function which
would implement the logic around "unlinking" in cil_list by using the
found "item".

Nevermind. Thinking more about this, this could make the code more
complex. I will test and review your v2 patch. Thanks!
