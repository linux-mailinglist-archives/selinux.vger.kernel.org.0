It is very hard to figure out what is going on in the policy provided
by the fuzzer. The best I can figure out is that the problem was
caused by something in an optional block that had been disabled and
deleted being referred to outside of the optional block. Removing all
of the optional blocks that are going to be disabled anyway eliminates
the problem, so that seems to confirm that idea.

This commit prevents that whole class of bugs from occurring.

libsepol/cil: Check for statements not allowed in optional blocks

The problem is definitely there before this patch. After this patch an
error is produced because a block is declared in an optional.

I hope that helps,
Jim
