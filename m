There are also problems with IP_PASSSEC/SCM_SECURITY that we've never
fully resolved (and have gotten a bit lucky over the years); it very
well could be time to add support for IP_SECURITY as the multi-LSM
replacement for SCM_SECURITY.  We could leverage the same LSM context
structures as in the other multi-LSM interfaces.  Existing
applications could continue to use SCM_SECURITY; in fact I believe we
could have both SCM_SECURITY and IP_SECURITY in the same message for
maximum compatibility.

https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-kernel/issues/24

For SO_PEERSEC, we should probably just introduce SO_PEERSEC2 or
similar, using the same multi-LSM context structures as the other
interfaces.

There is so much precedence for defining a token scalar value to
represent a "thing" that I don't know where to begin.  Look at IANA,
there are entire organizations that exist to map "things" to numbers.

If you're objecting to assigning LSMs fixed integer numbers you've got
to give me some very explicit reasons (complete with examples) as to
why that would be a mistake.

I'm not following you here.  See my comment above about better examples.

I already replied to Tetsuo's email, and while this particular point
about LSM ID numbers wasn't directly addressed, my response there
seems to apply equally well here: it's not so much about loadable
LSMs, it's about out-of-tree LSMs.  These are two very different
things, with different solutions.

I don't like making general comments, but when in doubt, consider me
not-a-fan of string-based identifiers in APIs.  Give me token scalar
values instead.

Enh, sure, whatever.  You'll remember my initial comment about not
being a syscall stylist; if the discussion has moved to seriously
discussing the syscall prototypes we should likely start a new thread
and bring in the syscall folks ... I vaguely remember there was a
mailing list for syscalls and API changes ...

I'm not sure I'm following your thinking, what would lsm_prev_ctx() do?

I don't understand what you mean by "prev"{ious} attributes.  I'm
thinking of lsm_current_ctx() as a multi-LSM replacement for
/proc/self/attr/current.  If, for example, we wanted something for
/proc/self/attr/exec I imagine we would create lsm_current_exec(), or
something similarly named, with a similar prototype.

Or perhaps we try to stick a bit closer to the procfs naming and go
with lsm_self_cur(...) and lsm_self_exec(...).  All things to discuss.
