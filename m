For some reason I completely glossed over the selinux_status == NULL
case. I guess I didn't see errors when testing dbus because verbose
logging wasn't turned on.

I'll take a look at what it would take to move over sestatus entirely
and if it's too tricky/error-prone, _I think_ it should be fine to
move the selinux_status == NULL check down with the MAP_FAILED case so
they both fall through to avc_netlink_check_nb().

I'll have to do a bit of digging to see how this will affect dbus, et
al. On first blush, it looks like they're just doing
avc_netlink_check_nb() in their watch thread. Presumably other object
managers are doing something similar so we would just need to make
sure there is a netlink fd available.
