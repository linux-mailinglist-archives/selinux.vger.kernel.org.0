The "enable" == "support" model in consistent with the expectations of
paying customers.

That is correct. Redhat has chosen to support only SELinux. If you want
TOMOYO to be enabled in a distribution you need to sell the value to a
distributor (really, really hard) Or (not recommended) become one yourself.

That's not quite the position. "Only in-tree, and someone has to want to use it
in the real world" is more accurate. Android isn't a distribution, neither is
Tizen. Having a major distributor include the LSM is a big plus.

It sure does. I'm waiting to see what happens if eBPF security modules
become popular. I can easily see distributions turning the BPF LSM off.

Exactly. A module would have to chose between being built-in and being loadable.
Before I go any further, I think that the loadable module manager LSM would be
very hard to get upstream. Most of the arguments against general support for
loadable modules would still apply. It is possible that an acceptable module
could be created, but it would have to address a lot of issues. It is a challenge
I don't expect to accept in this lifetime.
