Hi Linus,

Due to some personal logistics challenges over the next few days I'm
sending the SELinux pull request for Linux v6.4 a bit early.  Here is
a quick summary of the changes:

* Stop passing the 'selinux_state' pointers as function arguments
As discussed during the end of the last development cycle, passing a
selinux_state pointer through the SELinux code has a noticeable impact
on performance, and with the current code it is not strictly
necessary.  With this PR we simplify things by referring directly to
the single selinux_state global variable which should help improve
SELinux performance.  This change is responsible for most of the
diffstat in this PR.

* Uninline the unlikely portions of avc_has_perm_noaudit()
This change was also based on a discussion from the last development
cycle, and is heavily based on an initial proof of concept patch from
you.  The core issue was that avc_has_perm_noaudit() was not able to
be inlined, as intended, due to its size.  We solved this issue by
extracting the less frequently hit portions of avc_has_perm_noaudit()
into a separate function, reducing the size of avc_has_perm_noaudit()
to the point where the compiler began inlining the function.  We also
took the opportunity to clean up some ugly RCU locking in the code
that became uglier with the change.

* Remove the runtime disable functionality
After several years of work by the userspace and distro folks, we are
finally in a place where we feel comfortable removing the runtime
disable functionality which we initially deprecated at the start of
2020.  There is plenty of information in the kernel's deprecation (now
removal) notice, but the main motivation was to be able to safely mark
the LSM hook structures as '__ro_after_init'.  LWN also wrote a good
summary of the deprecation this morning which offers a more detailed
history:
- https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/927463/dcfa0d4ed2872f03

* Remove the checkreqprot functionality
The original checkreqprot deprecation notice stated that the removal
would happen no sooner than June 2021, which means this falls hard
into the "better late than never" bucket.  The Kconfig and deprecation
notice has more detail on this setting, but the basic idea is that we
want to ensure that the SELinux policy allows for the memory
protections actually applied by the kernel, and not those requested by
the process.  While we haven't found anyone running a supported distro
that is affected by this deprecation/removal, anyone who is affected
would only need to update their policy to reflect the reality of their
applications' mapping protections.

* Minor Makefile improvements
Some minor Makefile improvements to correct some dependency issues
likely only ever seen by SELinux developers.  I expect we will have at
least one more tweak to the Makefile during the next merge window, but
it didn't quite make the cutoff this time around.

Please merge, thanks.
-Paul
