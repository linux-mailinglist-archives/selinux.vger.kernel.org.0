You have always been allowed to inherit any block. That is by design.
The blockinherit just means that that block won't show up in policy if
nothing inherits it.

You are right that the binary policy will not have either of the rules
because no types have been assigned to the attribute. It still
resolves as I stated and that can be seen by using secil2tree. It
would have been better to use a type declaration instead, but I used
typeattribute because that was what the fuzzer had used.

Thanks,
