You can run `semodule -DB` to make SELinux more verbose. (use `semodule
-B` to make SELinux less verbose when youre done)

My guess is that some socket accesses are silently blocked. Is a long
story but the socket read and write accessed might be silently blocked
because they are often false positives caused by leaked file
descriptors.

In this case the read write on tcp_socket would be legit and would need
to be allowed.

So if you do a `semodule -DB` then reproduce a login, then look for avc
denials related to sshd_t, unconfined_service_t and tcp_sockets (my bet
is on read and write) but eventually sshd obviously also needs to
"accept" connections as well. In other words: "tcp_socket { getattr
setopt }" is incomplete but the next access attempts (read/write) are
silently blocked by policy and so without that it cannot do its job.
