I just tested with building a kernel with
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE=n and setting SELINUX=disabled in
/etc/selinux/config, and the system came up with selinuxfs unmounted,
sestatus and friends think SELinux is disabled, but it is enabled just
permissive with no policy.  I double checked the logic in systemd and
libselinux (selinux_init_load_policy()) and it does handle an error
return from writing to /sys/fs/selinux/disable gracefully.  So I guess
we can have it return an error without breaking userspace.
