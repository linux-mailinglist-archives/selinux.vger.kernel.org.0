You are right. EMA is more like a helper library than a real LSM. But 
the practical problem is, it has a piece of initialization code, to 
basically request some space in the file blob from the LSM 
infrastructure. That cannot be done by any LSMs at runtime. So it has to 
either be done in LSM infrastructure directly, or make itself an LSM to 
make its initialization function invoked by LSM infrastructure 
automatically. You have objected to the former, so I switched to the 
latter. Are you now objecting to the latter as well? Then what are you 
suggesting, really?

VFS is a completely different story. It's the file system abstraction so 
it has a natural place to live in the kernel, and its initialization 
doesn't depend on the LSM infrastructure. EMA on the other hand, shall 
belong to LSM because it is both produced and consumed within LSM.

And, Stephen, do you have an opinion on this?

After all, security_enclave_init() will need amendment anyway as one of its current parameters is of type 'struct sgx_sigstruct', which will need to be replaced with something more generic. At the time being, I'd like to keep things intuitive so as not to confuse reviewers.

OK. Let me make this change.

This is another part that confuses me. Per you comment here, I think you 
are OK with EMA being part of LSM (I mean, living somewhere under 
security/). But your other comment of calling ema_enclave_load() 
alongside security_enclave_load() made me think EMA and LSM were 
separate. What do you want really?
