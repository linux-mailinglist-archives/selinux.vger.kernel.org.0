As I mentioned above, I don't really like the stuff that one has to do
to support LSM stacking on the existing /proc interfaces, the
"label1\0label2\labelN\0" hack is probably the best (only?) option we
have for retrofitting multiple LSMs into those interfaces and I think
we can all agree it's not a great API.  Considering that applications
that wish to become simultaneous multi-LSM aware are going to need
modification anyway, let's take a step back and see if we can do this
with a more sensible API.

I think it's time to think about a proper set of LSM syscalls.  We
have avoided this in the past for several reasons, but over the past
couple of decades the LSMs have established themselves as a core part
of Linux with many (all?) major Linux distributions shipping and
supporting at least one LSM; I think we can justify a handful of well
designed syscalls, and with Landlock we have some precedence too.
While I realize syscalls are not the only kernel/userspace API option,
but given the popularity of namespaces I believe a syscall based
kernel/userspace LSM API has a number of advantages over the other
options, e.g. procfs/sysfs, netlink, etc.

Further, I think we can add the new syscall API separately from the
LSM stacking changes as they do have standalone value.  This would
help reduce the size and complexity of the stacking patchset, which I
believe would be a very good thing.  Introducing the syscall API
sooner would also allow any applications wanting to make use of the
crazy new stacked-LSM world a head start as they could be modified
while the kernel patches were making their way through the
review/update/merge/release process.

Thoughts?

To help make things a bit more concrete, I put together a quick
strawman this afternoon to get the discussion started.  I'm definitely
not a syscall stylist so please consider this more as an idea and
discussion starter at this point; if we agree there is value in going
this direction I can put together a proper patchset to introduce the
new API ...
