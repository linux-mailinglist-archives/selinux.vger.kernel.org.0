Yeah I was pretty happy with the timing it took to add this. But CI doesn't
necessarily need to be fast. We run a huge test matrix, Travis only
spins up a few at a time anyways.

I was surprised too, I was expecting that to be disabled, when I cat
cpuinfo, I was very happy.

I would love something like that (no idea what I am doing),
but it doesn't get rid of polling for network. We have to wait
for the sshd to be ready.

No benefit, just did something. They can live wherever....

That sounds good, I like being able to do that. I have no idea what vagrant
is. You could say im ignorant to vargrant!

Yep I agree. Thats how I run all my other projects, I dislike large
travis.yml files,
but I don't want to take on that workload right now, ideally get this
working and then port the other stuff.

Yeah I saw that. Thats why I had that verify link in the TODO
