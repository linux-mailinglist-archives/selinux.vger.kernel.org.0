An SELinux label is currently made up of several components. You
could add a new "subdomain" component. The subdomain component would
be ignored unless the process is in a namespace, in which case it
would be treated as an additional restriction. All processes in the
namespace could have the same domain as far as the host in concerned.
The subdomain would be propagated in the namespace according to normal
rules. The rules for propagating subdomains on the host could be simple
(e.g. don't do it) or as complex as you like.

It wouldn't be backward compatible, unless there's already mechanism
for ignoring label components that aren't being used.

Just a thought.
