 The sections that follow discuss the format of a security level and

 SELinux using dominance rules.
 
+## MLS or MCS Policy
+
+SELinux only knows of MLS, i.e. it has a MLS engine in the security
+server[^fn_mls_1] and a MLS portion of the policy configuration that drives
+that engine. The MLS engine has been leveraged by two different types of
+policy:
+
+- The MLS configuration modeled after Bell-LaPadula.
+- The MCS configuration that allows a process or object to be labeled with
+  categories. This has proved useful as a transparent isolation mechanism
+  for sandbox, container, and virtualization runtimes (see the
+  [**Virtual Machine Support**](vm_support.md#selinux-virtual-machine-support)
+  section).
+
+As a security level is a combination of a hierarchical sensitivity and a
+non-hierarchical (potentially empty) category set, MCS doesn't employ
+sensitivities since there is no hierarchical relationship to be enforced.
+Note however, that the SELinux kernel policy language defines *sensitivity*
+as a single value such as *s0*, *s1* etc.. Therefore the BLP defined
+sensitivity is formed in an SELinux MLS policy by a combination of the
+following (excluding the category statements):
+
+```
+sensitivity s0;
+sensitivity s1;
+dominance { s0 s1 } # s1 dominates s0
+```
+
+While an MCS policy does not use the BLP sensitivity definition, an SELinux
+policy still requires the following entries (basically defining a single level):
+
+```
+sensitivity s0;
+dominance { s0 }
+```
+
+The number of sensitivities, number of categories, and the set of MLS
+constraints used to determine whether a permission is allowed are entirely up
+to the policy author. See the
+[**The Reference Policy**](reference_policy.md#the-reference-policy) section
+for its configuration parameters.

 Using **Figure 9: *mlsconstrain* Statements controlling Read Down & Write Up**:
 
-1.  To allow write-up, the source level (l1) must be **dominated by**
-    the target level (l2):
--   Source level = s0:c3 or s1:c1
--   Target level = s2:c1.c4
+- To allow write-up, the source level (*l1*) must be **dominated by**
+  the target level (*l2*):
+  - Source level = *s0:c3* or *s1:c1*
+  - Target level = *s2:c1.c4*
 
 As can be seen, either of the source levels are **dominated by** the
 target level.
 
-2.  To allow read-down, the source level (l1) must **dominate** the
-    target level (l2):
--   Source level = s2:c1.c4
--   Target level = s0:c3
+- To allow read-down, the source level (*l1*) must **dominate** the
+  target level (*l2*):
+  - Source level = *s2:c1.c4*
+  - Target level = *s0:c3*
 
 As can be seen, the source level does **dominate** the target level.
 
 However in the real world the SELinux MLS Reference Policy does not
 allow the write-up unless the process has a special privilege (by having
 the domain type added to an attribute), although it does allow the
-read-down. The default is to use l1 eq l2 (i.e. the levels are equal).

 The reference policy MLS source file (policy/mls) shows these
