Taken separately the REQSKB change would be somewhat difficult to
detect as a regular user, putting the two changes into a single patch
means that one can use the presence of the "sctp_asconf" policy
capability as an indicator that the REQSKB fix is present in the
running kernel.

I prefer the permission names as they are (without the "_FROM" suffix)
as they better align with the SCTP RFCs.

I agree that ADD_IP is a much larger concern, arguably really the only
concern, since you can't set the primary address without first adding
it to the association.  It may sound odd, but since SET_PRIMARY MUST
(let's use some of that RFC language here <g>) come after a matching
ADD_IP, I made them equivalent in this patch so that both would be
covered by the same set of allow rules.  In other words, the policy
author really only needs to worry about the ADD_IP operation since
that is the critical parameter/op.  I did debate dropping the
SET_PRIMARY entirely, but keeping it made the legacy case easier and
in the peerlbl/TRUE case it still offers some value in the case where
the SET_PRIMARY is done at a different time from the ADD_IP
(potentially different network peer labels for each parameter/op).

Yes, I read the RFC too, but see my comments above.

To touch on the port issue quickly - while part of the motivation was
to blend better with the existing legacy case, I think there may also
be value in being able to control different ASCONF policies on a
port-by-port basis.  For example, maybe you want to allow pretty much
anything from an ASCONF perspective for the http ports but you want to
be much more restrictive about ssh.

Good point.  I suspect selinux_netlbl_sctp_assoc_request() will be
greatly simplified too, that will be nice.

Heh.  Okay, I see your point, but if that bit of code is too hard to
follow for someone they are going to have a very rough time with the
rest of the kernel code ;)

I'm going to leave this as-is.

Just as a FYI, the socket_setsockopt hook prevents a user from
overwriting an existing NetLabel socket option, and in the REQSKB case
we either overwrite any socket inherited NetLabel socket options in
the case of CIPSO or add another hop-by-hop option in the case of
CALIPSO (it's quicker that way).  We don't explicitly block a user
form setting a on-the-wire packet label using setsockopt() in the case
where no labeling is configured in case the application wants to
manage things on their own, but we do provide a socket-level
permission check (socket/setopt) so that policy developers can block
this if they want.
