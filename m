I'm not a huge a fan of that, we could just make it always run on make
invocation, but I thought it was only interesting on actual builds. We don'=
t
want to stop a make clean for instance.

So you want to check both libsepol and libselinux versions? So you want
me to add a libselinux version check?

I'm not following here. That file contains the version of libsemanage,
so I am not sure really how I could use that to implement the check
as we're checking for dependent package versions. Do you want to augment
that file with dependency versions?

Package config files appear to have also a requires field than can set
the minimum
version. Not sure if pkg-config has the ability to detect and error on
this condition.
