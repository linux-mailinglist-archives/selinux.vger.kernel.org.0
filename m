Thanks, I'll fix that in v2.

Good suggestion.

Sounds clearer.

I might not have been clear. This patch doesn't allow you to compile
after using "-A resolve". I will be working on that next.
I am thinking of creating a generic block "<block>", so blocks that
are resolved can be re-written using that.

So when writing out the AST for the resolve phase,

(block b
  (type t)
  (allow t self (CLASS (PERM)))
)

would be written as

;block b
(<block>
  (type b.t)
  (allow b.t self (CLASS (PERM)))
)

or, maybe I would also create a comment statement that wouldn't be
discarded by the parser

(<comment> "block b")
(<block>
  (type b.t)
  (allow b.t self (CLASS (PERM)))
)

I need to do similar things to blockinherits, blockabstracts, and
in-statements. I also would like to be able add a comment when an
optional is disabled.

I am open to suggestions.

Thanks for the review, I will work on a v2.
Jim
