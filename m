Yes, probably the network rules can't be generic enough to cover every case.

OK, let's forget this idea.

Perhaps instead this would work (I haven't tested it yet): don't use 
netifs or nodes for anything (label everything with generic types 
netif_t and node_t, which is actually the reference policy) but instead 
use netlabel tools to label peers according to interfaces and IP 
subnets. Then udevd etc. would invoke netlabel-config (or something 
similar) when network configuration changes. This would not require any 
changes to kernel, SELinux userspace except for netlabel tools, nor 
reference policy. The policy can be also read-only. Also, if it is 
determined that the IPSec etc. should be used in the local network, 
netlabel tools are needed to manage the case anyway.
