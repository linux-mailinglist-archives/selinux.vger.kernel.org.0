I never said it did. But no one ever suggested doing anything

says it does.

Sorry, "memory management" as in all that stuff around pages and
TLBs and who gets what pages, as opposed to keeping track of anything
on its own.

You have not been listening. Most LSMs use VFS. We haven't rolled VFS
functions into the LSM infrastructure.

Did you look to see what it is they're doing? If you had,
you would see that is nothing like what you're proposing.

The enclave code should be calling security_enclave_load(),
not the other way around. That assumes you're using the naming
convention correctly.

security_vm_enough_memory_mm() was discussed at length and there
wasn't a clean way to get the logic right without putting the code
here. security_file_permission() has the fs_notify_perm call for
similar reasons. Neither is anything like what you're suggesting.

And as I've said, that doesn't matter. You're still going about
using the LSM infrastructure backwards.

I can explain it, but you clearly have no interest in doing
anything to make your code fit into the system. I have a lot
of other things to be doing.

The only places where the blob freed by security_file_free()
may be allocated is security_file_alloc(). The security modules
are welcome to do anything they like in addition, provided
they clean up after themselves in their file_free() hooks.

If SELinux wants to support controls on enclave information,
and that requires additional data, SELinux should include
space in its file blob for that information, or a pointer to
the place where the enclave code is maintaining it.

That's the way audit works.

> If you are referring to buffers allocated in one layer and freed in els=
ewhere, you have got the code wrong. Buffers allocated in security_enclav=
e_load() is freed in security_file_free().

It's up to the security module's file_free() to clean up anything that
wasn't allocated in security_file_free(). Interested security modules
should call enclave_load(), and put the information into their portion
of the security blob. The module specific code can call enclave_file_free=
(),
or whatever interface you want to provide, to clean up. That might take
place in file_free(), but it also might be elsewhere.

Try looking at maintaining what you've put into the LSM code as
a separate entity. It makes it simpler. Really.

Then put it in the TEE system.

True in any case.

All the more reason to keep it separate. These things never get simpler
when they get more generalized.

I don't believe that for a second. 40 years of C programming
have taught me that trying to do multiple things in one place
is always a bad idea.

=2E.. and the LSM infrastructure doesn't care and
must not be made to care. It's all up to SELinux.

Right, which is why putting your lsm_ema_blob is wrong, and why
forcing into the file blob is wrong.

 LSM infrastructure or inside individual LSMs.

Yes. The latter.

> The reason to put it in the infrastructure, is that it depends on the d=

That's basic stacking behavior. "Bail on fail", which says that once
denial is detected, you're done.

> That's similar to vm_enough_memory() where the final __vm_enough_memory=
() call is made by the infrastructure but not individual LSMs.

Do you really understand the painful reasons that case is required?
And if so, why you aren't taking steps to avoid them?


>>> EMA blobs are allocated/freed *not* relative to any other blobs.
>> In the code you proposed they are freed in security_file_free().
>> That is for file blob management.
> Yes. EMA contributes to the file blob. But it only frees memory allocat=

That's not the way it's supposed to be done. The module tells
the infrastructure what it needs, which may include space for
EMA data. The module asks EMA for the data it needs and stuffs
it somewhere, and the file blob is a fine choice. The module
cleans up in file_free, or at any time before that. If no module
uses EMA, nothing goes in the blob. If two modules use EMA each
is responsible for the data it uses, which may be the same or
may be different.

I've looked at your code. Making it work the way it should would
not be difficult and would likely simplify a bunch of it.=20
