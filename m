I delayed my response in hopes the Fedora folks would also comment,
but I'm not seeing anything.

All this patch does is start executing on the deprecation path we laid
out when we marked the functionality as deprecated.  When we decided
to do this we had buy-in from the Fedora folks (the only ones who
still use this option);  if this is a problem for them then I would
like to understand what changed, and why.  If it is a matter of this
coming too quickly, that's okay, we can push this out another release
or two.  We can even drop the sleep down to a second or two.  Both the
timing of introducing the delay, and the length of the delay itself,
aren't important to me; it's the fact that we are adding a delay and
moving forward on the deprecation (just as we said we would).

What were you envisioning when we marked this as deprecated Stephen?
If not this, what were you thinking we would do?
