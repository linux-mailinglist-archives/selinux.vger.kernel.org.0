Okay, let us know what you find out.  I'm a little concerned that you
didn't see any additional AVC denials in the logs; if the system is
working in permissive and you're not seeing any denials with the
dontaudits removed something is off.

The basic idea is that you have some type attribute which represents
all the domains on the system and you grant that attribute the ability
to talk to unlabeled traffic.  Perhaps the Fedora patch might not be a
direct fit, but I imagine you could do something very similar for
Debian without too much difficulty (warning: I'm saying this without
looking at the Debian policy).

However, it is worth mentioning again that this approach allows
unlabeled traffic *everywhere* and isn't really suitable for a system
in a proper labeled network (it somewhat defeats the purpose of
setting up labeling in the first place).

I'm not sure I would jump to the same conclusion.  First the RHEL 7.x
policy, like RHEL 7.x in general, is quite old; second, while we do
regularly perform some basic labeled networking tests as part of the
SELinux test suite, it definitely doesn't get the same level of
everyday testing that other parts of SELinux receive.

If you hit a problem you can't solve don't be afraid to speak up.
Either it's something in your policy we can (hopefully) help you
resolve, or it's a real bug in the system that we can (hopefully) get
fixed for everyone.

Depending on the age of the kernel on your host, there *may* be issues
with it passing CIPSO traffic properly, even if it isn't configured
(there were bugs in older kernels that have since been fixed).
However, since you're not sending CIPSO traffic outside the guest this
shouldn't be an issue.

If you want to take even smaller steps, you can combine the NetLabel
domain and address selectors such that only specific apps/domains will
send labeled traffic over loopback.
