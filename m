That's fine with me.  FWIW, I think the rationale for using
pr_warn_ratelimited() for error returns from security_load_policy()
was that the failure could be entirely userspace-induced, i.e. just
pass the kernel an invalid policy.
The pr_err() messages on sel_make_bools/classes were in contrast
entirely kernel-internal errors and could leave the system in an
inconsistent state as you noted.
