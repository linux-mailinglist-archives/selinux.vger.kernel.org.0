Thanks Jeff, as well as everyone else who contributed reviews and feedback.

I've pulled this into a working branch and I'll be merging it with the
other sidtab patches before posting it to a "next-queue" branch for
review later this week.  When done, I'll send a note to the list, as
well as the relevant patch authors; your help in reviewing the merge
would be greatly appreciated.
