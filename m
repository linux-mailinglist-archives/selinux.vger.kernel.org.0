If you use the existing _rcu accessors you will get correctly enforced
dependency ordering on the reader side and correctly placed release
ordering on the updater side. I don't think that's a big overkill, and
you can use the RCU accessors to achieve the lockless traversal.

hlist_add() is not safe against a concurrent traversal because the
WRITE_ONCE() provides no memory ordering guarantees, allowing the readers
to see an uninitialised node.

How exactly would list_for_each_entry_lockless() and hlist_add_something()
differ from the RCU variants, assuming they're implemented correctly?
