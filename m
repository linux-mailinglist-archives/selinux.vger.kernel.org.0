You're right, I misread the systemd code (which I used as reference
for the comment; didn't bother to look at the old libsepol code). I
also typo'd "that" into "than"... The comment should say "[...] take
getcon_raw() is non-null and not "kernel" to mean that a policy is
already loaded." or similar.

Paul, do you want me to resubmit the patch?
