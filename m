I'll remove the BPF check and send an update.

I'll have a go at the perf checks next as I guess it will make it to
5.5 unlike the keys-acl (that I did tests for). I also have the simple
'watch_key' test that I'll send once in 5.5 (if it makes it).

I'll change this (I try to avoid interfaces in tests as you need to
lookup what they really contain and it may be more than you want, plus
just plain allow rules are much clearer (but that's just me))
