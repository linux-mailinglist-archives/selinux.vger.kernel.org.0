In the policy.conf language, there is a dominance statement that
specifies the hierarchical ordering of sensitivities.  There is no
equivalent for categories, and the kernel never compares category
pairs for any kind of >, =, or < relationship; it only compares subset
comparisons between two category sets.  So there is no hierarchy.  If
CIL defines a categoryorder, then that's unnecessary.
