I believe the latter is closer to what I was thinking: keep the
existing tests, add additional ones to test what you want.  The SCTP
test already haa a bunch of individual tests (over a hundred I
believe), a few more shouldn't be a big problem.  If we need to add
functionality to the SCTP test server and client programs we can do
that too.

This is one of the awkward parts of SCTP and mapping its behavior to
the existing socket approach.  I believe we discussed some of the
difficulties around locking an association to the first
peer/connection when the patches went in and we couldn't think of a
better way at the time.  If you, or anyone else, has a different
approach that you believe would work better, let's discuss it; just
keep in mind we can't affect/relabel existing things, that's a big
no-no :)

I would argue that it is still meaningful.  I would also mention that
the association labeling isn't just the peer label, but the
association's label itself.

Unfortunately we can't force a 1-to-1 socket/association as SCTP
supports both 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.  I agree it would be nice, but
that decision has already been made for us.

The getpeercon() API returns the label of the remote
peer/node/socket/association based on the initial network traffic.
This should remain unchanged.  If an SELinux aware SCTP application
that leverages the sequential/datagram behavior of SCTP instead of the
stream behavior, wants to know the label on an individual datagram it
should use IP_PASSSEC/SCM_SECURITY just as a SELinux aware UDP
application would.

The difference being that with SCTP an association exists whereas
there is no similar state for UDP.
