It is hard to please everyone :-}

Yes, calling back through the vfs layer.

I was told not to change or remove the __vfs_getxattr default behaviour, 
but use the flag to pass through the new behavior. Security concerns 
requiring the _key_ of the flag to be passed through rather than a 
blanket bypass. This was also the similar security reasoning not to have 
a special getxattr call.

[TL;DR]

history and details

When it goes down through the layers again, and into the underlying 
filesystems, to get the getxattr, the xattributes are blocked, then the 
selinux _context_ will not be copied into the buffer leaving the caller 
looking at effectively u:r:unknown:s0. Well, they were blocked, so from 
the security standpoint that part was accurate, but the evaluation of 
the context is using the wrong rules and an (cosmetically) incorrect avc 
report. This also poisons the cache layers that may hold on to the 
context for future calls (+/- bugs) disturbing the future decisions (we 
saw that in 4.14 and earlier vintage kernels without this patch, later 
kernels appeared to clear up the cache bug).

The XATTR_NOSECURITY is used in the overlayfs driver for a substantial 
majority of the calls for getxattr only if the data is private (ie: on 
the stack, not returned to the caller) as simplification. A _real_ 
getxattr is performed when the data is returned to the caller. I expect 
that subtlety will get lost in the passage of time though.

I had a global in_security flag set when selinux was requesting the 
xattrs to evaluate security context, denied as a security risk since 
someone could set the global flag. I had a separate special getxattr 
function in the earlier patches, denied for security issues as well, and 
others took issue with an additional confusing call site. I added the 
flag parameter, and that satisfied the security concerns because the 
value was only temporarily on the stack parameters and could not be 
attacked to bypass xattr security. This flag passed to __vfs_getxattr 
was also preferred from the security standpoint so that __vfs_getxattr 
got the _key_ to bypass the xattr security checks. There was a brief 
moment where the get_xattr and set_xattr calls shared a similar single 
argument that pointed to a common call structure, but th as requested by 
a few, but then denied once it was seen by stakeholders.
