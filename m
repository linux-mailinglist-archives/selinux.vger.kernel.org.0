That would be great but I don't think it is quite that easy
unfortunately. I'm not a travis-ci expert by any means, but I don't
think it provides us with a way to replicate the current steps
required to enable SELinux in Debian or Ubuntu.  Debian's current
approach to enabling SELinux involves installing some additional
packages, running a selinux-activate script to modify the kernel
command line in the grub configuration to enable SELinux in the kernel
and to update some other configurations (e.g. adding pam_selinux to
pam configs), rebooting to come up with SELinux enabled in the kernel
and to label all filesystems, and rebooting a second time to come up
with everything including init in the right SELinux domain.  In
contrast I think travis-ci just provides you with a stock Ubuntu LTS
image and allows you to install additional packages and run commands
on that running instance, but not to specify custom kernel parameters
initially or to reboot the system before proceeding with further
commands (if anyone knows differently, speak up). We'd have to get to
the point where enabling SELinux in Debian is possible without
requiring a reboot at all.  And then we'd have to wait for that
support to find its way into one of the Ubuntu images supported by
travis-ci.  Might be easier to just get travis-ci to support Fedora or
CentOS images in the first place. Regardless, allowing the testsuite
to be run by users of other distributions is worthwhile IMHO.
