Per feedback from you all, my colleague Tushar has posted a patch series 
that defines a generic IMA hook to measure critical data from other 
subsystems (such as SELinux, AppArmor, Device-Mapper targets, etc.)

Link to the patch series is given below:

	https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11711249/

Shortly I will re-post the SELinux state and hash of policy measurement 
patch that will be based on the above patch series.
