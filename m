The reason why one is presented with an option to "clear" /tmp is because
/tmp is a shared location. That property makes it so that file context
specifications usually do not work for these locations in general and
/tmp in particular. Relabeling does not apply there -because setfiles is
told to ignore these locations- also not with
fixfiles (-F) onboot. So telling people to run fixfiles onboot && reboot
instead of clearing /tmp does not address the challenge.

What I find strange is that one is not also presented with an option to
clear /var/tmp, because the same applies there. In that sense, I believe,
this opportunity to clear /tmp is half baked. It does not solve the
underlying issue of addressing locations that have no file context
specifications associated with them for one reason or another.
