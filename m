That's the /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks feature I mentioned in my 
email above.  It isn't based on the target of the symlink; it is only 
based on the attributes of the follower process (e.g. root), the 
attributes of the parent directory containing the symlink (e.g. /tmp), 
and the attributes of the symlink file (e.g. /tmp/foo -> /etc/shadow). 
At no point is it checking anything about the target of the symlink, 
e.g. /etc/shadow.  If dwalsh creates a symlink under /tmp (ln -s 
/etc/shadow /tmp/foo) and root tries to follow /tmp/foo, then that will 
fail because 1) the process fsuid (root) != the /tmp/foo symlink owner 
(dwalsh), and 2) /tmp is a sticky and world-writable directory, and 3) 
the /tmp directory owner (root) != the /tmp/foo symlink owner (dwalsh). 
Note that conditions (2) and (3) render the check useless for your use 
case, since you want to prevent following any symlinks writable by 
container processes in any directory within the container filesystem, so 
the directory need not be world-writable/sticky and the parent directory 
UID/label might be identical to the symlink UID/label.

The existing SELinux lnk_file read permission check enables you to apply 
stronger label-based controls to all symlinks within the container 
filesystem, not just ones in /tmp-like directories.  Don't allow 
unconfined_t or any other privileged domain read permission to 
container_file_t:lnk_file (or preferably to any file type for which 
:lnk_file create is allowed to container process domains), and you'll 
never have to worry about them following a symlink writable by a 
container process.  This of course assumes that the container filesystem 
is always labeled with a type that is untrusted, whether via mount 
contexts or actual labels.
