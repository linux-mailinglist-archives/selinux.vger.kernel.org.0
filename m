Prior to commit 3a2f5a59a695a73e0cde9a61e0feae5fa730e936, SELinux
would check sigchld permission between each eligible target of a
wait*(2) system call and the process that invoked wait*() to filter
what processes could have their status checked. Hence, this is likely
the case that systemd is calling wait*() on the process.
