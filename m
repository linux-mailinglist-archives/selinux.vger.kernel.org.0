Hm... did you use the stock Fedora kernel RPM as the baseline? If so,
this could be because on stable Fedora releases the kernel package is
built with release config and kernel-debug with debug config, while on
Rawhide there is only one kernel package, which is built with debug
config. Under debug Fedora config the numbers are completely different
due to the overhead of various debug checks. I don't remember the
"after" value that I got when testing the patched Rawhide kernel with
the default debug config, but on stock Rawhide I got 43%, and on
Rawhide kernel rebuild with release config I got 65% again.
