Sure, but the tool should continue to work and provide useful messages
when running on kernels without that change. Pointing to the document is
valid and should be done, that is an agreed point. But the tool can do
some checks, narrow down the possible causes for the error message and
provide something that in most cases will make the user make progress.

We're in violent agreement here. :-)

Sure, lets then wait for others to chime in and then you can go ahead
and submit that patch.
