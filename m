Yes, I think that would be worthwhile.

My biggest objection is to adding a parameter to the hook calls.
The security_inode_init_security() - security_old_inode_init_security()
organization looks wrong to me as written.

There are really three cases here:
	Neither EVM nor initxattrs - taken care of by the "old" variant.
	EVM, but no initxattrs - which doesn't gather the EVM data.
	EVM and initxattrs - which gathers and uses the EVM data.

The code we have now is cleanest for the least common "old" variant,
which is used in only two places, reiserfs and ocfs2. I would suggest
a slightly different approach to getting you what you're after.

Let's change the hook definition for inode_init_security to take a
struct xattr * and the fs_data rather than the name/value/length triple.
It will require a temporary struct xattr in security_old_init_inode_secur=
ity,
but that's a corner case anyway. The security module specific code would =
be
easy to adapt. In the current environment, where there can only be one
module providing a hook, SELinux or Smack will fill in the xattr and retu=
rn.
In the future the modules will have to find an empty slot for their data.=


If your evm_init_inode_security() is registered last you will get
the desired behavior.=20

The MAX_LSM_EVM_XATTR value can be easily computed at compile time:

#define MAX_LSM_EVM_XATTR ( 1 + \
	( IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX) ? 1 : 0 ) + \
	( IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK) ? 1 : 0) )
Yes, you'll waste stack if only one of the modules is active.
On the other hand, if you only compile in one the value will be
perfect and you'll avoid allocation and associated headaches.
