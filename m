AFAIK (and from experience) yes, CAP_MAC_ADMIN and root. Theres also
setfiles_mac_t for this.

I agree but its not mounted on the host. It just installs a tree on the
host, labels that a then uses systemd-repart with --offline [1] option to
copy the tree to a disk image (no root needed and no mounting needed)

You'd still need to be able to associate an invalid label with the file.

[1] "--offline=3DBOOL

    Instructs systemd-repart to build the image offline. Takes a boolean or=
 "auto". Defaults to "auto". If enabled, the image is built without using l=
oop devices. This is useful to build images unprivileged or when loop devic=
es are not available. If disabled, the image is always built using loop dev=
ices. If "auto", systemd-repart will build the image online if possible and=
 fall back to building the image offline if loop devices are not available =
or cannot be accessed due to missing permissions.

    Added in version 254.
