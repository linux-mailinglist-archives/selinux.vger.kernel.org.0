I would argue that the examples you mention above
(/sys/fs/selinux/class, etc.) are different enough from the policy
capabilities that it isn't a fair comparison.  Although given your
other responses (below), it's probably not worth our time digging into
this argument further.

That is definitely one of my concerns; the last thing I want to do is
start a Debian-esque argument about init systems :)

It sounds like we may not need this after all, but if we do have to go
this route, I would be okay with establishing a
range/subset/namespace/etc. of policy capabilities for use by
userspace so long as we somehow ensure that there is a clear
separation between kernel and userspace policy capabilities.  The last
thing I want is to add a new policy capability to the kernel only to
find out that the capability name already conflicts with someone's
policy, that would be very bad.

We would probably want to enforce some sort of prefix string on the
userspace policy capabilities during policy load to ensure that we
don't have accidental overlap between kernel and userspace
capabilities.
