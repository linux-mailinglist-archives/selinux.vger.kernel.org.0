I believe your patches above fixed the race I was seeing. I was able to
make it through a full validation run without any crashes. Without those
patches applied, I would see several crashes resulting from this race
over the course of a validation run.

I'll continue to test with your changes and let you know if I end up
running into the other race you spotted.
