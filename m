Hm... I didn't realize that the function is actually quadratic.

Note that the compiler will only emit these instructions if you
compile with the right target platform (-mpopcnt or something that
includes it on x86_64). Portable generic builds will usually not use
it. Still, even without the special instruction __builtin_popcountll()
should generate more optimal code than the naive
add-each-bit-one-by-one approach. For example, I came up with this
pure C implementation of 64-bit popcount [1] that both GCC and Clang
can compile down to ~36 instructions. The generic version of
__builtin_popcountll() likely does something similar. (Actually, here
is what Clang seems to use [2], which is pretty close.)

FWIW, I tested the __builtin_popcountll() version with the caching
patch reverted (built without popcnt support) and it actually
performed even better than the old code + caching (it went down to
~0.11% of semodule -B running time). A naive popcount implementation
without caching didn't perform as good (was slower than the old code +
caching).

So... we could just open-code some good generic C implementation
(cleanly written and properly commented, of course) and then we
wouldn't have to rely on the compiler builtin. OTOH, the SELinux
userspace already uses non-standard compiler extensions
(__attribute__(...)), so maybe sticking to pure C is not worth it...
Either way I think we should revert the caching patch along with
switching to an optimized implementation (it would no longer be worth
the added complexity IMO).
