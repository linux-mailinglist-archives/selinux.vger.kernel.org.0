Do you happen to remember the reasons why it wasn't acceptable? We are
ready to start pushing for disabling SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE in
Fedora, but we're not sure why it is so crucial. Knowing what we need
to address before disabling/removing it would help a lot.

I think what Casey was suggesting is to add another flag that would
switch from "no policy loaded, but we expect it to be loaded
eventually" to "no policy loaded and we don't expect/allow it to be
loaded any more", which is essentially equivalent to checking
selinux_enabled in each hook, which you had already brought up.
