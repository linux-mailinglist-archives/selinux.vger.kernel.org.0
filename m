Yes, this makes sense to me.

The current AVC interface allows an object manager to explicitly set
the enforcing mode and ignore the underlying system enforcing mode,
such that one can have an object manager running permissive while the
kernel and other userspace object managers running enforcing for
development purposes.  So we'd still need to support that scenario I
believe.  That said, providing an option to use sestatus instead of
netlink and potentially making that the default going forward might be
of interest as long as it doesn't break compatibility.  The sestatus
code already falls back to netlink if the kernel doesn't support the
status page.

I haven't looked closely but would guess that we could use the same callbacks.

As long as the final state is correct, I don't think so, but I'm not
sure what scenario you are considering.
