I think this applies to CIPSO/CALIPSO but not `unlabeled` mode which is 
used in my example.

MLS is not very interesting for users in general and so neither will be 
CIPSO/CALIPSO. Maybe labeled IPSec could be useful in some controlled 
corporate environments where all parties are relatively trusted.

But I think `unlabeled` mode, together with other networking controls, 
could be very useful for all users. For some reason, it's bit hard in 
Linux to give each application an individual firewall while this has 
been easy in Windows for a long time. With SELinux network controls it's 
possible to enforce application level access control but the knobs seem 
to be weird.

Yes, that's probably safer.
