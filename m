Hi Tushar,

The above Subject line should be truncated to "IMA: add policy to
measure critical data".

This intro is besides the point.  The patch description should describe
what is meant by "critical data".

I don't understand what you mean by "non-vetted" components, nor how
measuring critical data may impact the overall reliability of the
system.

The system owner or adminstrator defines what they want to measure,
including "critical data", based on the policy rules.  They might
decide that they want to constrain which "critical data" is measured by
specifying "data_sources:=", but that decision is their perogative.  
The default should allow measuring all critical data.

 A simple example of "critical data" could be some in memory structure,
along the lines of __ro_after_init, or hash of the memory structure. 
Once the data structure is initialized, the "critical data" measurement
shouldn't change.    From the attestation server perspective, the IMA
measurement list would contain a single record unless the critical data
changes.  The attestation server doesn't need to know anything about
the initial value, just that it has changed in order to trigger some
sort alert.

thanks,

Mimi
