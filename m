+## Labeled Network FileSystem (NFS)
+
+Version 4.2 of NFS supports labeling between client/server and requires
+the ***exports**(5)* / ***exportfs**(8)* '*security_label*' option to
+be set:
+
+```
+exportfs -o rw,no_root_squash,security_label localhost:$MOUNT
+```
+
+Labeled NFS requires kernel 3.14 and the following package installed:
+
+```
+dnf install nfs-utils
+```
+
+Labeled NFS clients must use a consistent security policy.
+
+The *selinux-testsuite tools/nfs.sh* tests labeled NFS using various labels.
+
+[^fn_ns_1]: For example, an ftp session where the server is listening on a
+specific port (the destination port) but the client will be assigned a random
+source port. The *CONNSECMARK* will ensure that all packets for the ftp session
+are marked with the same label.
+
+[^fn_ns_2]: Note only the security levels are passed over the network as the
+other components of the security context are not part of standard MLS systems
+(as it may be that the remote end is a Trusted Solaris system)
+
+[^fn_ns_3]: These are the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) daemons that exchange
+encryption keys securely and also supports Labeled IPSec parameter exchanges.
