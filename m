Fully agree and this broader discussion is really helpful to come up with
properly balanced solution.

Undoubtedly, SELinux is the powerful, mature, whole level of functionality that
could provide benefits not only for perf_events subsystem. However perf_events
is built around capabilities to provide access control to its functionality,
thus perf_events would require considerable rework prior it could be controlled
thru SELinux. Then the adoption could also require changes to the installed
infrastructure just for the sake of adopting alternative access control mechanism.

On the other hand there are currently already existing users and use cases that
are built around the CAP_SYS_ADMIN based access control, and Perf tool, which is
the native Linux kernel observability and performance profiling tool, provides
means to operate in restricted multiuser environments(HPC clusters, cloud and 
virtual environments) for groups of unprivileged users under admins control [1].

In this circumstances CAP_SYS_PERFMON looks like smart balanced advancement that
trade-offs between perf_events subsystem extensions, required level of control
and configurability of perf_events, existing users adoption effort, and it brings
security hardening benefits of decreasing attack surface for the existing users
and use cases.

Well, yes, it is really good that Linux nowadays provides a handful of various
security assuring mechanisms but proper balance is what usually makes valuable
features happen and its users happy and moves forward. 

Gratefully,
Alexey
