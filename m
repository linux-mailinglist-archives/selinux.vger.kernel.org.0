Thanks also goes to all the people who worked in the userspace and
distros to get us to that point.  The kernel patch is the easy part ;)

True, but I would prefer to do that later once we've landed this
without any major breakage.  The only reason I combined the
__lsm_ro_after_init changes with the runtime disable changes is that
the latter doesn't make sense without the former, and I worry that
separating the changes into two patches would lead to problems if/when
people start cherry picking for backports.
