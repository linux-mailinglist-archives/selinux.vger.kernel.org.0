While I'm happy to host it, I think it might be better if we hosted it
in the community GitHub repo - what would you think about creating a
new repo under https://github.com/SELinuxProject?  Perhaps
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/notebook?  While it might seem a bit
odd to host an ODT file in a git repo, it is a good way to keep track
of historical changes and there are other tools such as the issue
tracker and "release" hosting which might be helpful.

However, the last thing I would want to do is put a hurdle between you
and the doc.

Let me know what you think, I'm happy to create a new repo for you on
the SELinuxProject GH org and set you up with the necessary
permissions - assuming the others don't mind, and I can't imagine they
would.
