I am aware of this and that is why I want to keep existing types,
domains and labels and not break those exceptions. What I want to
change is make the kernel not dissallow access when RBAC/TE is violated,
unless MLS rules are violated.

It would require reworking the whole policy and rewriting MLS exceptions.=
..
It is very near to writing a policy from scratch, I think.

Patching the kernel to achieve this will be OK, but, after studying the c=
ode,
it seems that the whole selinux was first designed to block access
when RBAC/TE rules are violated, and then MLS was added there... So it is=
 not
obvious which part of the code would better be changed to achieve this ai=
m,
and how hard it will be to achieve it.
