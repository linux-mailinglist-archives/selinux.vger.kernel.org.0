In the olden days before SELinux, when we were working with the CMU
Mach microkernel and its IPC system [1],
we auto-generated access vector definitions (permission names) from
the Mach Interface Generation (MIG) files,
and each access vector had a general portion with common permissions
and then a service-specific portion with the
generated permissions. As long as you have no more than 32 interfaces
per interface, you can fit that in an access vector
without xperms; else you could use xperms for that purpose. WRT
xperms, it's just a matter of mapping each interface to
an integer index which likely already happens and then using that to
generate a mapping for policy writers to use.
