I don't see how that would work or be advantageous.  Within the capable 
hook, the security module(s) decide whether or not to allow the 
capability, and generate any relevant LSM audit records.  It is 
precisely at those two points (deciding and auditing) that we need the 
information; both occur within the existing capable hooks.  Calling a 
separate hook before the capable call and e.g. saving the information in 
the task security structure for later consumption during the capable 
call offers only overhead, no benefit.  Calling a separate hook after 
the capable call is too late to be of use - the decision and auditing 
are already done.  And both hooks would be invoked from precisely the 
same function at the same point.  If the information wasn't already 
readily available at the point of the hook call, it might be a different 
matter, but that isn't the case here.

We introducing such an interaction - that's the point.

It only requires passing the information to the security modules at the 
point of the hook call, and then SELinux or other security modules can 
implement it themselves without any other changes to the kernel.  We 
aren't changing the way the base capabilities logic works.

We can't provide that degree of granularity without the additional 
information.  Let's say domain A needs DAC override for files of type B 
and for nothing else.  To support this requirement, SELinux policy has 
to include at least:
1) allow A self:capability dac_override;
2) allow A B:file { read write };

Let's say that A also reads from files of type C and writes to file of 
type D.  So SELinux policy also has to allow:
3) allow A C:file read;
4) allow A D:file write;

There are files within type C and within type D that are under different 
DAC ownerships or modes.  Only some of these files should be accessible 
to A.  But because dac_override is global and not scoped to specific 
sets of files, the combination of these permissions now allows A to 
override DAC on files of type C and of type D; thus it can read all 
files of type C and write to all files of type D even though it has no 
legitimate need to do so.

As you note, historically privilege bracketing hasn't worked so well, 
and fundamentally it puts the trust burden on userspace for something 
that could be enforced at the system level quite easily and in a 
race-free manner.

Some might argue that's a flawed design.

As above, I don't see any way to do that that isn't just adding overhead.
