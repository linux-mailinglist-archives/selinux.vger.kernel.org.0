Hello,
I wanted to spend some time testing different approaches before
replying. Your awk command works fine, but I am wondering whether its
complexity is needed at all. For example, why not directly grab the
"extern int" lines in selinux.h (using sed -n s/.../.../p). This would
work well with libselinux and avoid using awk for this simple task,
but not for libsemanage... or it could, with:

    cat ../include/semanage/*.h | \
    sed -n 's/^extern \+int \+\([0-9A-Za-z_]\+\) *(.*$/\1/p'

Actually, the main reason why it is currently not possible to migrate
from "gcc -aux-info and awk" to "cat | sed" is caused by the fact that
the file generated by "gcc -aux-info" adds "extern" before all
function prototypes. Adding "extern" directly to the prototypes of all
exported functions in header files seems to be required in order to
use something else than "gcc -aux-info" to generate the glue code that
handles exception in Python bindings.

Therefore I suggest the following approach:
1. add "extern" to all exported functions in libselinux and
libsemanage public headers (I can send a patch for this tomorrow if
you don't want to do this)
2. change exception.sh to use something else than "gcc -aux-info" to
generate the glue code
3. add something so that "make test" compares the result of "$CC
-aux-info" (if $CC is gcc-compatible) with the new way to find
functions, in order to report differences in the generated glue code.
This could for example consist in adding some code in exception.sh
such that "./exception.sh test" performs this check.

Would this suit you?

By the way, I found out that libsemanage generates glue code for
select() and pselect() too, as it does not filter the output of "gcc
-aux-info". This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

Thanks,
Nicolas
