[NOTE: adding SELinux list as a FYI for potential breakage in upcoming kern=

As mentioned previously, if you aren't able to fit the testing into
your automated framework, you'll need to do some manual testing to
verify the patches.

I did share my concern about changes in packet length across the
network path and an uncertainty about how different clients might
react.  While you tested with Linux based systems, I requested that
you test with at least one non-Linux client to help verify that things
are handled properly.

Perhaps you don't view that concern as credible, but it is something
I'm worried about as a common use case is for non-Linux clients to
connect over an unlabeled, single label/level network to a Linux
gateway which then routes traffic over different networks, some with
explicit labeling.

If you don't believe that testing this is important Ondrej, trust
those who have worked with a number of users who have deployed these
types of systems that this is important.

I've shared my concerns with you, both in previous threads and now in
this thread.  This really shouldn't be about convincing you to do The
Right Thing and verify that your patch doesn't break existing users,
it should be about you wanting to do The Right Thing so your work
doesn't break the kernel.

It's not about you or I, it's about all of the users who rely on this
functionality and not wanting to break things for them.

Test your patches Ondrej, if you don't you'll find me increasingly
reluctant to accept anything from you in any of the trees I look
after.

I've seen DaveM do this before, but as Jakub has been the one pulling
the labeled networking patches after my ACK I thought DaveM was no
longer doing that type of work.  My guess based on previous experience
is that DaveM didn't see any comments on your latest patchset - as we
were still discussing things in the previous thread - but only DaveM
can comment on that, and it really isn't very important at this point.
