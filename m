Yours.  I think that requiring source pages to be actually mapped W is
not such a great idea.

In addition.

But I named the function badly and gave it a bad signature, which
confused you.  Let's try again:

int security_enclave_load_from_memory(const struct vm_area_struct
*source, unsigned int maxperm);

Maybe some really fancy future LSM would also want loff_t
source_offset, but it's probably not terribly useful.  This same
callback would be used for EAUG.

Following up on your discussion with Cedric about sigstruct, the other
callback would be something like:

int security_enclave_init(struct file *sigstruct_file);

The main issue I see is that we also want to control the enclave's
ability to have RWX pages or to change a W page to X.  We might also
want:

int security_enclave_load_zeros(unsigned int maxperm);

An enclave that's going to modify its own code will need memory with
maxperm = RWX or WX.

But this is a bit awkward if the LSM's decision depends on the
sigstruct.  We could get fancy and require that the sigstruct be
supplied before any EADD operations so that the maxperm decisions can
depend on the sigstruct.

Am I making more sense now?
