I don't understand why.  Is there a userspace component that relies on
SCM_SECURITY today for anything real (more than just blindly passing
it along and maybe writing to a log somewhere)?  And this doesn't
provide support for a composite SCM_SECURITY or SCM_CONTEXT, so it
doesn't really solve the stacking problem for it anyway.  What am I
missing?  Why do you care about this patch?
