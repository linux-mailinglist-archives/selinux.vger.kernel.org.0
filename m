OK, so it seems that reverting comes out as the best choice here.

BTW, I'm looking at rw_verify_area() and I see this "If (ppos)" check
and the comment above it... And then I look at autofs_write(), which
passes &file->f_pos, while ksys_write() passes file_ppos(file), which
checks FMODE_STREAM and returns NULL if it is set. And since the
autofs pipe should be a... well... pipe, which AFAIK implies
FMODE_STREAM, file_ppos() should return NULL for it. So shouldn't
autofs_write() use file_ppos(file) instead of &file->f_pos? Not sure
if there are any practical implications, but seems more
correct/consistent that way... And in that case most of the
rw_verify_area() checks would be skipped anyway. And
file_start_write()/file_end_write() do nothing on non-regular files,
so it seems kernel_write() vs. __kernel_write() makes only very little
difference for pipes.
