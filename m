Regardless of if it is The Right Thing, changes like this should
probably be put into a separate, unrelated patch.

I think there are a few things in dump_common_audit_data() that should
have been done differently, but unfortunately the audit records (and
IMHO the many stupid design decisions that went into them) are
effectively part of the kernel API and need to be treated with care.
