I will note here that I suspect there is currently something broken
with libselinux / unlabeled sids

libselinux consumers still use *invalidated* contexts associated with
inodes to compute access vectors.

for example rpm will not consistently work until the filesystems are
relabeled after a new policy is loaded that invalidates contexts
currently associated with /bin/sh (entrypoint for setfscreatecon to
"rpm_script_t")

systemd will not consistently work until the filesystems are relabeled
after a new policy loaded that invalidates contexts currently associated
with (i suspect) parent directories for socket activated sock files
(maybe setfscreatecon?)
