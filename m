I am not a fan of optionals either. Disabling optionals has been a
source of many bugs in CIL, but it would have been hard to make
translating binary modules to CIL work without them.

99% of the time optionals are used as a way of including rules when a
module is present without causing an error when it is not, so this
should provide everything that is needed.

Since you have a lot of freedom, I would recommend a system like that
rather than optionals.
