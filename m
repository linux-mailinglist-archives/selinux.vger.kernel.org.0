Does it actually fail or just print these warnings? IIRC, @sds replied with some
superfluous linking warnings, but we ignored them. I tried looking
through my mail
and the archive but I couldn't find it.

objdump -T is probably a better way to do this than what I had with
readelf, as it shows the version.

Let me roll a patch, I probably have to go through the others as well.
