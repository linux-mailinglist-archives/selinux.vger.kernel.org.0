Nope.  I've been very busy lately.

Yep.

I believe I did in some previous post on this thread, another related
one, or some off-list email.  There has been a lot of mail on this
issue ...

Regardless, if I remember correctly I think I was talking about using
the domain and port label to do a type transition to a new type when a
socket was created as the result of accepting a new connection.  It's
pretty much the same 'type_transition ...' statement that you listed
above (in the approach you gave up on).

Oh, I thought you were concerned about the child sockets created by
accepting new connections on a bound/listening socket.
