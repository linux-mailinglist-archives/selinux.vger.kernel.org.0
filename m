The network peer label is a process label, it is intended to represent
the security attributes of the remote process.

However, as I mentioned above, the socket:connect permission is likely
not the proper permission to use in the ASCONF case.

That's disappointing.  I'll drop what I'm doing and work on this,
because someone needs to fix this.

I'll reserve final judgement because I need to go read the ASCONF
related RFCs instead of just skimming them, but I'm not overly swayed
by the argument above.  SELinux should be about providing mechanisms
which allow policy writers to control what entities on a system have
access to a specific blob of data, restricting the details of the
protocols which are used to access that data is getting a bit out of
scope unless those details directly affect the ability to access the
data.  I think we should keep the name_connect check, although likely
with a different name in the ASCONF case, however, that checks the
socket/sock's label against the connection endpoint's addr/port and is
something different from the network peer labeling controls we've been
talking about.  Although I believe the ASCONF/name_connect check
should address the security concerns of an ASCONF induced change
affecting the endpoint of an SCTP connection and effectively bypassing
the earlier name_connect check done when the connection was first
established.
