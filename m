Hi Mimi and Paul

It seems that selinux_audit_rule_match has been returning -ESTALE for a 
very long time. It dates back to 376bd9cb357ec.

IMA used to have a retry mechanism, but it was removed by b16942455193 
("ima: use the lsm policy update notifier"). Maybe we should consider 
bring it back or just add a lock in ima_lsm_update_rules().

FYI, once ima received the notification, it starts updating all it's lsm 
rules one-by-one. During this time, calling ima_match_rules on any rule 
that is not yet updated would return -ESTALE.
