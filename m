So I just wanted to share, that the test suite is running with a PASS on
a travis CI instance with a nested KVM of Fedora32.

https://travis-ci.org/github/williamcroberts/selinux/builds/687592735

Next week I'll clean this up and make sure that its working consistently.
I've had 2 hangs when building the libselinux src, not sure why..
I don't want a CI check that'd flaky, so I want to do some more testing.

An example is on this build:
https://travis-ci.org/github/williamcroberts/selinux/builds/687496735

I'm gonna assume I need to allocate more memory and im gonna bump
the vcpu count as well to match the host. As Travis gives us two cores.
