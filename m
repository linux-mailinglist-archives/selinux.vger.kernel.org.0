I think you are conflating things. Any label mapping/translation
mechanism where the label at every layer has to resolve to a single
underlying label will have problems with divergent policies between
the host and guest.
The virtiofsd approach avoids that problem by allowing each layer to
store its own label that only needs to be meaningful with respect to
its policy. Within each layer, that label is protected by the layer's
MAC policy. No mapping is required.
At the host, the guest label is also protected by the host's MAC
policy but not as a MAC label (because it isn't a MAC label for the
host), just as an attribute of the file. In the case of SELinux, a
process must have setattr permission
to the file to set one of its attributes; that's a MAC check separate
from the DAC check.
So for example if the host policy says that only virtiofsd can set
attributes on those files, then the guest MAC labels along with all
the other attributes are protected against tampering by any other
process on the host.
And obviously virtiofsd was already free to fake whatever guest MAC
labels it wants since it is implementing the filesystem to the guest.
Offering an explicit check over the ability of a process on the host
to set one of these guest MAC label attributes would be nice for
additional safety (especially if we cannot in fact limit setting of
attributes of these files
to only virtiofsd on the host) but it isn't strictly required.
