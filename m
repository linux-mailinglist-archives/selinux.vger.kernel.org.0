I've had to argue this before while doing the namespaced file
capabilities implementation.  Perhaps this would be worth writing something
more formal about.  My main argument is, even if we want to claim that the
capabilities model is and should be object agnostic, the implementation
of user namespaces (currently) is such that the whole view of the user's
privilege must include information which is stored with the object.

There are various user namespaces.

The Linux capabilities ( :-) ) model is user namespaced.  It must be, in
order to be useful.  If we're going to use file capabilities in distros,
and distros are going to run in containers, then the capabilities must
be namespaced.  Otherwise, capabilities will not be used, and heck, should
just be dropped.

The only way to find out which user namespace has privilege over an inode
is to look at the inode.

Therefore, object information is needed.

Until now we've sneaked around that by doing things like capable_wrt_inode_uidgid()
and rootid_from_xattr().

Again, this crucial: IMO, you have to be able to use a distro the same way in a
container and not.  Either we support using capabilities in a user namespaced
container, or we drop capabilities support will not be used, and we may as
well drop the module.

Now, yes, if someone tries to extend this stuff to do pathname parsing, then we
might have to put our footsies down.  But we've been dancing around this for a
long time anyway, so passing the inode in so we can do better logging gets a +1
from me.
