Generally redefining a port type like this isn't recommended because
as I mentioned, it will cause any allow rules in the base policy
written against the other port type to not get applied to this port
and hence may cause breakage. Usually you would just add allow rules
permitting access to the already defined port type, and only create
your own portcons for ports not covered by the base policy.
