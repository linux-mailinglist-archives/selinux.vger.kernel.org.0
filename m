I haven't yet looked at these patches in detail, but a few quick thoughts:

* I would be very curious to see what the performance improvement is
on a current kernel build from either selinux/next or Linus' tree.
Performance numbers from an extremely old commercial distribution
aren't of much interest to mainline development.

* In general I'm a fan of reducing the number of Kconfig options
whenever possible in favor of the system auto-tuning based on usage
(e.g. the loaded policy).  Obviously this isn't possible in some
cases, but I worry that there is always a risk that if we expose a
build knob there is a risk it will be mis-configured.  My initial
reaction is that this patch set exposes way too many things as Kconfig
knobs.  As an aside, I also worry about runtime tunables, but to a
much lesser extent (the risk is less, the benefits greater, etc.).

* The AVC hash table improvement doesn't exactly look like a
sea-change, have you tried it on multiple policies and work loads?  I
wonder if the small improvement you saw changes on different workloads
and/or policies.

* In general I agree with your statement about using common code, e.g.
hash functions, to improve code quality, maintenance, etc. but the
hashing functions you are replacing are rather trivial and easily
maintained.  Not to mention their performance in the SELinux code is a
well known quantity at this point.

I'll take a closer look at these patches, likely next week after the
merge window closes, but in the meantime if you could provide some
more current performance numbers with a better explanation of the
workloads I think it would be helpful.

Thank you.
