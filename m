The problem with the existing CI is that it broke recently :) I
realize now, that probably no one knows but me (I noticed it when
preparing to merge Richard's SCTP patch), so I should have explained
that better in the commit message... Basically all my attempts at
fixing it quickly and nicely have failed, so I figured it would be
easier to try to adopt the KVM approach instead.

I see your point about the existing CI being faster (well, at least
when there is a cache snapshot available...), but unfortunately the
testsuite logic is too much dependent on the kernel version and the
uapi headers that it's not easy to keep it working in the Travis
environment... Add to it the complexity of selinuxfs mocking, building
and installing two policy variants... It was good while it lasted, but
I think it's time for it to retire now.
