This is looking good to me.  Only questions I have are:
1) Have you confirmed that a testsuite failure within the VM gets
correctly propagated up and treated as a failure by travis-ci itself?
2) Have you seen any problems with instability in running of the tests
due to the additional complexity and time?  I've certainly already
seen instances where travis-ci of selinux or selinux-testsuite fails
randomly due to timeouts or something when downloading external
components.
