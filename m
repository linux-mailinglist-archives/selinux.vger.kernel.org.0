 While this section cannot help with those points, here are some notes to
 help during the design phase:
 
-1.  Determine what objects are required and the access controls
-    (permissions) that need to be applied.
-2.  Does SELinux already have some of these object classes and

 However, do not try to reuse a current object that may be similar to the
 requirements, it will cause confusion at some stage. Always generate new
 classes/permissions.
 
-1.  If the application has APIs or functions that integrate with other
-    applications or scripts, then as part of the object manager
-    implementation these may need to support the use of security
-    contexts (examples are X-Windows and SE-PostgreSQL that provide
-    functions for other applications to use). Therefore if required,
-    provide common functions that can be used to label the objects.
-2.  Determine how the initial objects will be labeled. For example will
-    a configuration file be required for default labels, if so how will
-    this be introduced into the SELinux userspace build. Examples of
-    these are the X-Windows (***selabel_x**(5)*), SE-PostgreSQL
-    (***selabel_db**(3)*), and file context series of files
-    (***selabel_file**(5)*).
-3.  Will the labeling need to be persistent across policy and system
-    reloads or not. X-Windows is an example of a non-persistent, and
-    SE-PostgreSQL is an example of a persistent object manager.
-4.  Will support for the standard audit log or its own be required (the
-    *libselinux* functions default to *stderr*). Use
-    ***selinux_set_callback**(3)* to manage logging services.
-5.  Decide whether an AVC cache is required or not. If the object
-    manager handles high volumes of requests then an AVC will be
-    required.
-6.  Will the object manager need to do additional processing when policy
-    or enforcement changes are detected. This could be clearing any
-    caches or resetting variables etc.. If so, then
-    ***selinux_set_callback**(3)* will be used to set up these
