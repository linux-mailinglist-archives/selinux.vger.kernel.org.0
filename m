I am working with Thomas Petazzoni and the OpenWrt community to add
SELinux support to OpenWrt. OpenWrt is a Linux distribution tailored
for running routers and similar devices.

	https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/3207
	https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/10664

I am interested in enabling KERNEL_SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP, which I
believe to be necessary if I am to enable and disable SELinux enforcement
at runtime. However, it seems that enabling this option in the kernel
causes the system to hang:

[...]
[    1.668419] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
[    1.675189] Waiting for root device PARTUUID=4ba37c2a-02...
[    2.100751] tsc: Refined TSC clocksource calibration: 1995.376 MHz
[    2.113719] clocksource: tsc: mask: 0xffffffffffffffff max_cycles: 0x39863c423f0, max_idle_ns: 881590675958 ns
[    2.122334] clocksource: Switched to clocksource tsc

It is not clear to me whether the kernel or the init process is
hanging. Things boot fine when KERNEL_SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP=n.

I have tried a number of kernel command line parameters, thinking perhaps
SELinux is preventing the use of the console. This has not yet helped.

The OpenWrt init is available at:

	https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/procd.git,

and it now includes a commit from Thomas that calls
selinux_init_load_policy().

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this hang? Is there
a user-space requirement to finish the boot process when
KERNEL_SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP=y?

I would also very much appreciate any comments on the two GitHub merge
requests above. I think OpenWrt would provide a compelling use case for
SELinux, and thus I (along with Thomas) have invested a fair amount of
time trying to get this accepted by the OpenWrt team.
