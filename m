Yes, sorry. The tool is perf tool (part of kernel tree). If its binary is granted 
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability then the tool can collect performance data in system wide 
mode for some group of unprivileged users.

This patch allows replacing CAP_SYS_ADMIN by CAP_SYS_PERFMON e.g. for perf tool and 
then the tool being granted CAP_SYS_PERFMON could still provide performance data
in system wide scope for the same group of unprivileged users.

Hope it's got clearer. Feel free to ask more.

Thanks,
Alexey
