Yeh; although the details of getting the semantics right is tricky;
in particular, the stuff which clears capabilitiies/setuid/etc on writes
- should it clear xattrs that represent capabilities?  If the host
  performs a write, should it clear mapped xattrs capabilities?  If the
namespace performs a write should it clear just the mapped ones or the
host ones as well?  Our virtiofsd code performs acrobatics to make
sure they get cleared on write that are painful.
