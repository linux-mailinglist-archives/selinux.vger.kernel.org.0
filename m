Alternatively, a pair of tiny in-tree or out-of-tree stackable LSMs
that don't make any security decisions, and label every labellable
process/socket/thing with something predictable, would make it really
easy for both kernel and user-space developers to test this and the
user-space code that uses it (D-Bus and others).

For example, they could label process 1234 and all sockets created by
process 1234 with "contexttest1\0pid1234\0contexttest2\0process1234" or
something like that.

I'd love to see AppArmor in upstream kernels support SO_PEERSEC and
SO_PEERCONTEXT, but setting up a development machine to stack AppArmor
and SELinux (and still be able to boot, without one or the other LSM
forbidding something important) seems likely to be harder than setting
it up to load some toy LSMs.
