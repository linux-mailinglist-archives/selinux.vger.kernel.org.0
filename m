I would prefer that yes.  I know it sounds a little odd, but I'd
rather see folks develop and test against what we believe to be the
latest subsystem code, which is what lives in the dev branch.  If
there are merge conflicts, I'd rather we see them when merging the fix
into the stable-X.Y branch so we are aware of the conflict at
development/submission time rather than waiting for the next merge
window.  Having done this for a number of years at this point, I've
learned to appreciate seeing merge conflicts as early in the
development cycle as possible and I've also learned that they are
often not as scary in practice as we imagine.

Of course all of this is a general rule since you can't specify every
single situation in guidance like the above; if there is something
that you believe is particularly ugly you can always write the mailing
list, or me directly if the issue is sensitive, and we can sort it
out.  If after a few months (year?) this proves to be too painful we
can always revisit this and update the policy, it's definitely not set
in stone.

Hopefully you are less confused now?
