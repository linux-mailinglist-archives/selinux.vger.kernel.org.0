Interesting. I will try this out. Would this not require at least a
"fsuse trans" statement in policy?

https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy/blob/master/policy/modules/kern=
el/filesystem.te#L89

Also I am not sure if that support would make much sense on a filesystem
where files are created my the kernel in reaction to some event.
