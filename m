Yes, nothing necessarily wrong with the patches, but they would need
to be updated and resubmitted.

I am very hesitant about the selabel patches. I have never been
involved with the selablel code before and I am very worried about
potential ordering changes leading to labeling problems.
I would be ok with Christian updating them and resubmitting them after
this release. I am willing to review the code, but I really need some
other people to test them before I would be ready to merge them.

I never saw this patch series. I got kicked off the mailing list at
one point and had to resubscribe. I went through the archives, but
must have missed this series.
I'll take a look at it.
