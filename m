I will propose SO_PEERCONTEXT and /proc/.../attr/stack/context,
both of which will use the Hideous format, in the next round. I
appreciate the suggestion and discussion.

Yes, echo being built-in can't be guaranteed. Most shells have some
way of doing the equivalent.

True when there is such a newer version. I'm sure you're aware
of how much system software out there hasn't been updated in this
century.

Agreed. It's a tool for the times of transition.

Point. /proc/self/attr/stack/context and SO_PEERCONTEXT comprise a better=

I agree.

Yes.

The AppArmor team is already moving away from using the /proc/self/attr
intefaces. /proc/self/attr/smack is already there, and the transition
begun. The SELinux developers seem firmly set in the position that there
is no reason they should ever change. In the long term I think we'll get
the conflict sorted out. It's hard to say what value of "long term"
we're looking at.=20

In addition to the big name distros/systems like RedHat, Ubuntu and
Android there are a bunch of smaller players who don't have the
expertise and/or staffing and/or upstream clout to update system
services. Some of these are targets for stacked LSMs. They will be
delighted to get updated programs, but will muddle through with the
compatibility mechanisms if they have to.

Thank you again for your insights on this topic. My next round
should provide what you've suggested.
