IMO, #1 only makes sense if it's stripped down to avoid auditing and
locking complications, i.e. gets a pass/fail at security_enclave_load()
and clears VM_MAY* flags during mmap().  If we want WX and W->X to be
differentiated by security_enclave_init() as opposed to
security_enclave_load(), then we should just scrap #1.

I'm not convinced this will be a meaningful limitation in practice, though
that's probably obvious from my RFCs :-).  That being said, the UAPI quirk
is essentially a dealbreaker for multiple people, so let's drop #1.

I discussed the options with Cedric offline, and he is ok with option #2
*if* the idea actually translates to acceptable code and doesn't present
problems for userspace and/or future SGX features.

So, I'll work on an RFC series to implement #2 as described below.  If it
works out, yay!  If not, i.e. option #2 is fundamentally broken, I'll
shift my focus to Cedric's code (option #3).
