IIUC he was against adding an FMODE flag, while I was rather
suggesting a new function parameter (I realize it probably wasn't
clear from what I wrote). The latter is less prone to accidents and
any new user would have to set that parameter to *something* and so
would be forced to think about whether he needs an LSM check or not.
Whereas with a separate _nosec()/nolsmcheck()/_whatever() function
they would likely just use the kernel_write() function they already
know and may not even realize that there is some decision to be made.

But that's just my opinion, I would still be happier with a separate
function than reverting to __kernel_write().

Unfortunately not all of the kernel_write() calls seem to be of the
kind that we want to skip the permission checking. One in particular
that caught my attention is this btrfs one:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9-rc6/source/fs/btrfs/send.c#L561

Basically a userspace process passes some fd via ioctl and kernel then
writes something in it. If we don't do any check here (and BTW we in
fact want the current's creds to apply here), then the process could
pass any open fd and bypass any LSM write permissions to the file
behind that fd. Possibly there are some checks that restrict what can
be passed there (I didn't check), but it would still be fragile to
rely on them.

So I guess we can't just skip the check whenever the kernel_*()
function is called.

Most users of kernel_write() seem to also create/open the file
themselves, usually using the current's creds, so this would break
consistency when applied universally. Autofs (and also
bpfilter_send_req()) are special in that they first get the fd from a
userspace process and then write into it from other tasks' syscalls.
Then there are one or two users that create the file using
shmem_kernel_file_setup(), which does use prepare_kernel_creds(), but
the resulting file is marked S_PRIVATE, so all LSM checks are already
skipped for it anyway.

Yeah, I'm starting to think checking "kernel creds -> userspace
object" access vectors on purpose doesn't make much sense... you would
pretty much want to always allow that (no point in kernel blocking its
own operations) so just skipping the check in those cases where using
the current's creds doesn't make sense seems to be a better choice.

BTW, I don't have the candidate patch written yet, as I haven't had
time and also need to process new information after having reviewed
the existing callers.
