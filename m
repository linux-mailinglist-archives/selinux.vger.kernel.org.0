I'm still confused as to why you want to track execute permissions on the
enclave pages and add SGX-specific LSM hooks.  Is there anything that
prevents userspace from building the enclave like any other DSO and then
copying it into enclave memory?  I feel like I'm missing something.

  1. Userspace loads enclave into regular memory, e.g. like a normal DSO.
     All mmap(), mprotect(), etc... calls are subject to all existing
     LSM policies.

  2. Userspace opens /dev/sgx/enclave to instantiate a new enclave.

  3. Userspace uses mmap() to allocate virtual memory for its enclave,
     again subject to all existing LSM policies (sane userspaces map it RO
     since the permissions eventually get tossed anyways).

  4. SGX subsystem refuses to service page faults for enclaves that have
     not yet been initialized, e.g. signals SIGBUS or SIGSEGV.

  5. Userspace invokes SGX ioctl() to copy enclave from regulary VMA to
     enclave VMA.

  6. SGX ioctl() propagates VMA protection-related flags from source VMA
     to enclave VMA, e.g. invokes mprotect_fixup().  Enclave VMA(s) may
     be split as part of this process.

  7. At all times, mprotect() calls on the enclave VMA are subject to
     existing LSM policies, i.e. it's not special cased for enclaves.


The SGX ioctl() would need to take mmap_sem for write, but we can mitigate
that issue by changing the ioctl() to take a range of memory instead of a
single page.  That'd also provide "EADD batching" that folks have
requested.
