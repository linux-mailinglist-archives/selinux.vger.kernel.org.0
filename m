Doesn't this mean, if the user
is set then group is completely
ignored?
By doing that you indeed avoid
the problem of "completely
inaccessible tap". However, that
breaks my setup, as I really
intended to provide tap to the
owner and the unrelated group.
This is because, eg when setting
a CI job, you can add the needed
user to the needed group, but
you also need to re-login, which
is not always possible. :(

Also completely ignoring group
when the user is set, is somewhat
questionable. At the very least,
perhaps then you need to explicitly
clear the group when the user
is set, to avoid the confusion.
Having "either user or group"
sounds like a sensible semantic,
but its a different semantic.
