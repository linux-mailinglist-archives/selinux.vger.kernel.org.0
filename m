Hm, indeed, I misunderstood the semantics behind it. Let's disregard
that argument then.

Still, I'd say the situation "a remote process wants to potentially
redirect communication to a different address" is different enough
from "local process intends to initiate a connection to a given
endpoint" that it warrants a special permission.

Perhaps I missed it, but I don't think you actually stated your reason
for a different permission. Is it similar to mine above or something
different?

We also restrict things like capabilities, setsched, etc. that are not
(only) about data.

Let me try a more concrete argument:
Basically, ASCONF allows any attacker who can convince a peer (that
has net.sctp.addip_enable sysctl set) to open an authenticated SCTP
connection with them to get the peer to send a packet to practically
an arbitrary IP address, which can turn into a DDoS attack if you have
many such peers. So a hypothetical administrator who is forced to
enable net.sctp.addip_enable because of one application that relies on
it might want to use SELinux to restrict this ADD_IP capability only
to sockets created by that single application and not the rest of the
SCTP users on the system, thus potentially reducing the attack
surface.

I admit it's an edge case of an edge case, but since we jump through
hoops to have SCTP properly supported in SELinux, we might as well
cover all the bases here.

It only checks it against the port, not the address.

Ok, I didn't think about the name_connect check at first, but looking
closer at what sctp_process_asconf_param() does, I get the impression
that name_connect doesn't really make sense in case of neither ADD_IP
nor SET_PRIMARY, because the port is taken from the association and
not from the ASCONF chunk (i.e. it remains the same). So I don't think
it makes sense to check name_connect in the case of ASCONF, in which
case we are back to the socket-self check being needed.
