Hi Tushar,

Please don't include the filename in the Subject line[1].   The Subject
line should be a summary phrase describing the patch.   In this case,
it is adding support for measuring the buffer data hash.

SELinux is an example of measuring large buffer data.  Please rewrite
this patch description (and the other patch descriptions in this patch
set) without using the example to describe its purpose [1].

In this case, you might say,

The original IMA buffer data measurement sizes were small (e.g. boot
command line), but new buffer data measurement use cases are a lot
larger.  Just as IMA measures the file data hash, not the file data,
IMA should similarly support measuring the buffer data hash.

Each patch in the patch set builds upon the previous one.   (Think of
it as a story, where each chapter builds upon the previous ones.)  
With rare exceptions, should patches reference subsequent patches. [2]
