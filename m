These were commits 685f4aeeadc0b60f3770404d4f149610d656e3c8 and
c08c4eacab8d55598b9e5caaef8a871a7a476cab respectively;
the commit descriptions provide the rationale for the changes and the
associated bugs.

That shouldn't be the case; selinuxfs is unmounted by
selinux_init_load_policy() if SELinux is disabled in the config file
too.

It is true that the existence of the config file is a weak indicator;
that check was only added to address a particular bug where systems
had no /etc/selinux/config and expected SELinux to be treated as
disabled.
With respect to containers, the Fedora / Red Hat approach in general
has always been to treat SELinux as disabled within the container so
that userspace within the container doesn't try to load policy or set
labels.
The entire container is run with a single security context.

This would essentially be a revert of the prior two commits which
would seem to re-introduce the original issue that was being fixed.
