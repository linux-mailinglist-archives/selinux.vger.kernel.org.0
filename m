Thank you!  I've been playing with this series locally all morning and 
so far it mostly works as expected.  The only minor surprise so far is 
if I do something like:

(type my_type1)
(type my_type2)
(type my_type3)
(typeattributeset my_attr (my_type1 my_type2 my_type3))
(allow my_attr my_attr (process (signal signull)))
(deny my_type1 my_attr (process (signal)))

I get rules like this:

$ sesearch -A -s my_attr policy.33
allow deny_rule_attr_11 my_attr:process { signal signull };
allow my_attr my_attr:process signull;

Since deny_rule_attr_11 is a subset of my_attr (specifically, my_type2 
and my_type3), both of those types get the "signull" permission from the 
second rule on the attribute, and only strictly need the "signal" 
permission (which my_type1 doesn't get)

It's obviously not a real problem, since it's just redundant policy and 
both versions are functionally equivalent.  It's just a little weird 
browsing the rules using sesearch, particularly with large permission 
sets (My first attribute test involved using "all" on the file class and 
denying one permission from a type, and it was mildly challenging to 
manually verify the results looking at the allow rules in a large list.)

Anyways, besides that minor issue everything I've tried so far has 
worked well and the overall concept seems sensible and helpful. 
Although, I still need to get my head around the specifics of the 
attribute handling, and I haven't looked thoroughly at the code yet.

I intend to do more thorough testing and code review, but I don't expect 
I'll have time before the holidays, so that will likely come in January. 
  Since I don't have time for anything more thorough now, hopefully some 
first impressions are helpful in the interim.
