Thanks for writing this patch!  I notice it hasn't been applied upstream.  Is
this still being worked on?

A couple comments below:

This function is used as a pthread_key destructor.  But, it's also marked with
__attribute__((destructor)), making it a library-level destructor too.  That's
confusing.  Is there a reason for that?  I would have expected these to be two
different functions.  The pthread_key destructor should call
pcre2_match_data_free on the value passed as an argument, while the
library-level destructor should delete match_data_key.

Since match_data_key_initialized is checked without holding key_mutex, can't the
above code race with the below code in match_data_thread_free?

        __pthread_mutex_lock(&key_mutex);
        if (--match_data_key_initialized == 1) {
                __selinux_key_delete(match_data_key);
                match_data_key_initialized = -1;
        }
        __pthread_mutex_unlock(&key_mutex);

Perhaps deleting the pthread_key is just not something that should be done at
all?
