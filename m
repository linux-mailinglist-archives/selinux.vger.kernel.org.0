githubs sounds good, however as the document is quite large I'm
splitting into sections like on the wiki as it will make easier editing
(should anyone feel the need).

I've converted with pandoc using 'markdown_strict', where it converts
text to md but most tables into html (as their own md table format will
not render in some viewers). With firefox and the Markdown Viewer
Webext, the samples I've done look ok.

As with all these conversion apps, pandoc leaves a lot of cleaning up
to do, so I'll be some time. I'll send you the files once I'm done.
Thanks for your support.
