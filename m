If you mean RCU + reference counting, that's actually mentioned in RCU
documentation in quite a few places as an option, e.g. [1] or [2].

As for the completion, I'm not aware if it's been used like this yet,
but it seems to fit the purpose nicely. At least I hope there are no
hidden gotchas, but I couldn't think of any. I know it from the crypto
subsystem, where it's often used to wait for the result of an
asynchronous operation.

Yes, I'll address that in the next revision.
