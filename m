Hmm...that's interesting. I just tried in Fedora using one of the
type_transitions already defined in the default policy and although it
appears to use the type_transition to compute the new SID for the
create check, ls -Z of the file after creation showed it labeled
cgroup_t instead. So it doesn't appear to be working or I am doing it
wrong.
