I assume you're thinking of clearing all VM_MAY* flags in sgx_mmap()?

I don't follow.  The alignment is known because userspace knows the size
of its enclave.  The initial unknown is the address, but that becomes
known once the initial mmap() completes.

I assume 7 = R, W, X, RW, RX, WX and RWX?

If my above assumptions regarding VM_MAY* and the "7 segments" are
correct, IIUC you're proposing that an LSM could have policies for each
of the anon inodes, e.g. grant/deny RWX vs. RW vs RX.  Am I in the
ballpark?

I (obviously) don't fully understand your proposal, but I don't think we
want to hook inodes, e.g. AppArmor doesn't implement inode_permission()
but does implement file_mprotect() and mmap_file(), which feel like the
natural hooks for this sort of thing.  I also think it's overkill, e.g.
AppArmor doesn't have a concept of EXECMOD, EXECMEM, EXECHEAP, etc.., so
I don't think we need to go beyond detecting W+X scenarios.

Starting with your original idea of tracking "safe to execute" and
Cedric's of propagating the permissions from the source VMA, but tweaked
with your new idea of clearing VM_MAY* and a custom MAP_FIXED/mprotect().

Add SGX_IOC_MPROTECT (or SGX_IOC_MAP_REGION?) that works as follows:

  1. Track VM_MAY{READ,WRITE,EXEC} flags for each enclave page.
  2. SGX_IOC_ADD_REGION, i.e. EADD, initializes the VM_MAY* flags for each
     enclave page based on the source VMA.
  3. sgx_mmap() only works with PROT_NONE, skips alignment stuff if
     MAP_FIXED, and clears VM_MAY{READ,WRITE,EXEC}.
  4. mprotect() on /dev/sgx/enclave doesn't work because the VMA doesn't
     have any VM_MAY{READ,WRITE,EXEC} capabilities.
  5. Deny mremap() post-ECREATE as the address and size of the enclave
     are fixed at ECREATE (in hardware).
  6. SGX_IOC_MPROTECT works like normal mprotect(), except the VM_MAY*
     flags are pulled from the enclave pages, and its call to
     security_file_mprotect() is VM_READ|VM_EXEC by default.  The LSM call
     sets VM_WRITE iff the enclave page has both VM_MAYWRITE and
     VM_MAYEXEC.  The idea here is to require READ and EXECUTE to run an
     enclave, and only require WRITE on /dev/sgx/enclave when the enclave
     can execute modified memory.

To support SGX2 down the road, which will want to convert a page to
executable on the fly, we could add:

  7. SGX_IOC_EXTEND_PERMISSIONS enables userspace to extend the VM_MAY*
     flags for an enclave page, e.g. to make a page executable.
     SGX_IOC_MPROTECT is still required to actually map the page.
     Notably, adding a RW page to the enclave, e.g. to grow its heap,
     doesn't require WRITE, whereas adding a RWX page, e.g. for dynamic
     loading, would require WRITE.  This can only extend!  E.g. userspace
     can't circumvent the WRITE requirement by clearing VM_MAYWRITE.

Note, FILE__WRITE on /dev/sgx/enclave is essentially equivalent to
FILE__EXECMOD.  Using FILE__WRITE in this way means there are no changes
to SELinux (triggering FILE__EXECMOD would be awkward), and AppArmor also
picks up extra protections for enclaves.

I don't see any reason to allow duplicate EADD as it serves no purpose,
e.g. doing so changes the enclave's measurement and that's it.
