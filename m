Yes, I saw that too and decided we were better off printing something
each time since it really should only ever happen once on a well
behaved system.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that, and couldn't find anything relevant
while grep'ing under Documentation/process.  There used to be a
Documentation/feature-removal.txt (or a file with a similar name)
which tracked these things, but I guess it migrated over to
Documentation/ABI during the last Documentation shuffle a couple of
years ago.

I'll send out an updated patch in just a moment.
