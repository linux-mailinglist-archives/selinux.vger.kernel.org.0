There is some redundancy between the last sentence of the last
paragraph above and the preceding paragraph; the last sentence notes
that it is used for both subject and objects (not just subjects as in
the preceding paragraph) and that it is technically the context
associated with the unlabeled SID that is used for invalidated SIDs,
not the SID itself.  The unlabeled SID itself is used as per the 1st
sentence of the last paragraph above.
