The labeled networking stuff can be a little confusing at times, I'm
glad you were able to wrap your head around it.

/me nods

Yes, we could do that.  I do think there is some value in checking the
peer label when sending SEQPACKETs and the two labels differ, but we
can do both, the tests are not mutually exclusive :)

I'm not entirely sure what you are suggesting, but just to be clear,
the peer label should always be the label of the remote ("peer").  If
the remote end of the connection is running with s0:c0.c10, it doesn't
matter if the local end initiates communication at s0:c5, the peer
label from the local's perspective should be s0:c0.c10 as that is
label of the remote/server.

It gets a little confusing when you start thinking about how
setsockcreatecon() affects this, and SCTP adds its own twists with the
different associations, but the core idea should remain the same.
