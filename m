That certainly *could* be done, and I guess the decision could be left
to the LSMs, but I'm not convinced this adds value.  What security use
case does this cover that isn't already covered by requiring EXECUTE
(e.g. lib_t) on the enclave file and some new SIGSTRUCT right on the
.sigstruct?

ISTM you should need EXECMEM or similar to run Graphene, then.
