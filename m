I don't quite understand where the term "dynamic tracking" came from. 
What's done in the patch is just to track which page was contributed by 
which file. It's been done for all file mappings in Linux.

Back to the "race condition". A similar situation already exists in 
SELinux, between EXECMOD and EXECMEM. Say a file does *not* have EXECMOD 
but the calling process has EXECMEM. Then WX could be granted to a fresh 
private mapping (because of EXECMEM). However, once the mapping has been 
written to, X should have been revoked (because of lack of EXECMOD) but 
will still be retained until dropped by an explicit mprotect(). 
Afterwards, mprotect(X) will be denied. That's not the same situation as 
in this enclave case but they do share one thing in common - X should 
have been revoked from an existing mapping but it isn't, which is just a 
policy choice.

Nothing is unsolvable. Here are 2 options.
(1) We argue that it doesn't matter, similar to the EXECMOD/EXECMEM case 
on regular file mappings described above; or
(2) EXECMOD is required for both W->X and X->W transitions, hence W 
requested by the 2nd process will be denied because X has been granted 
to the 1st process while EXECMOD is absent.

Please note that #2 is effectively the same concept as 
PROCESS2__ENCLAVE_EXECDIRTY in Sean's patch, except that EXECMOD is per 
file while ENCLAVE_EXECDIRTY is per process.
