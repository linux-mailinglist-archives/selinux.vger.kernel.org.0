Sorry, perhaps I was unclear. The new classes proposal is just to use
a different security class i.e. fd, pidfd, memfd classes, such that
allow rules would be written accordingly, e.g. allow foo_t self:fd
use; allow foo_t domain:pidfd use; That was Paul's proposal. Using a
derived type via type_transition is the 3rd option, and that one would
require introducing logic into selinux_file_alloc_security() to call
security_transition_sid() and impose that overhead on all fd creation,
which is likely a non-starter.
