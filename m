If criu restores a process tree you need to have the required capability
in the starting user namespace and by design this means you also have it
automatically in all child user namespaces. Let alone that if you/criu
created the user namespace you have full privileges over it anway.
While criu restores a process tree it needs to retain its privilege
level. The individual tasks in the process tree that criu restores will
obviously be restored with the creds they were checkpointed with so it's
not like any of them inherit any capabilities they didn't already have
after criu finishes. So I don't see why any of this would be a problem.
Restoring into a (pre-existing) pid namespace hierarchy is another
problem but how this can be solved using the set_tid array was outlined
during Plumbers last year; one of the reasons this is an array.

I'm sorry, but nack.
We're not going to do shenaningans like that with pidfds and clone3()
just to cater to this specific use-case that is solvable in less hacky
ways.
