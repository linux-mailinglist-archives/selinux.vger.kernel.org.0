Elaborate on labeling. Touch on the significance of the default statement, on various av permissions related to labeling using the libselinux API, and on how the kernel and unlabeled initial security identifiers are used to address labeling challenges in special cases such as initialization and failover respectively.

v2: fixes patch description
v3: adding patch description, s/policies/policy's/, split unlabeled and kernel descriptions for clarity
v4: fixes another typo in description and emphasize system initialization a bit
v5: emphasize kernel threads with kernel isid description
v6: forgot to mention defaultuser, can only associate one label with isids
v7: copied and pasted feedback from Stephen Smalley
v8: missed a s/access vectors/permissions/ instance
v9: restructure unlabeled isid paragraph
