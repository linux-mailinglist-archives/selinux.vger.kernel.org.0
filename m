This is fantastic, I haven't looked at it fully yet. But I'm assuming this would
be the initial bulk work to get the make check on travis better. So in theory
we can just replicate this on Travis. Is my understanding correct here?
Ideally, we can get to a point where if CI is passing, its already an RC
candidate.
