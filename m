I didn't suggest a generic "security" namespace that would include
non-LSM access checks, just using the name "security" instead of "LSM",
but never mind.

I'm confused about the goal of this thread...  When I read namespace I
think about the user space interface that enables to tie a set of
processes to ambient kernel objects.  I'm not suggesting to force all
LSM to handle namespaces, but to have a unified user space interface
(i.e. namespace flag, file descriptor...) that can be used by user space
to request a new "context" that may or may not be used by running LSMs.

> clone*(), one for each LSM that wanted to implement a namespace.

My understanding of this proposal was to create a LSM-wide namespace,
and one of the reason was to avoid one namespace per LSM.  As I
explained in my previous email, I think it would make sense and could be
convincing.

My idea was that using CLONE_NEWLSM would just fork the current/initial
namespace used by LSMs to tie security policies/configurations to
processes, but as John already said, it would be the responsibility of
each LSM to either inherit and keep in sync the parent policy (e.g.
SELinux) or start with a blank/default one (e.g. Yama).

One way to configure a newly created namespace could be to load a
configuration in the parent namespace (e.g. with one of the new LSM
config syscall and a dedicated flag) that would only be applied to child
namespaces when they are created, similarly to attr/exec for execve(2).
I think this is what you meant with the LSM_UNSHARE flag, right?

Should we still talk about "namespace" or use another name?

I'm not sure having a set of namespace file descriptors without related
clone flags would be acceptable, at least for what we currently call
Linux "namespace".
