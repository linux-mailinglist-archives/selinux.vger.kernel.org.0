Not sure if you are thinking of symlink attacks or hard link attacks. 
SELinux supports preventing the former by restricting the ability to 
follow symlinks based on lnk_file read permission, so you can prevent 
trusted processes from following untrustworthy symlinks.  SELinux 
supports preventing the latter by restricting the ability to create hard 
links to unauthorized files.  But you need to write your policies in a 
manner that leverages that support, and a fully unconfined domain isn't 
going to be protected via SELinux by definition; ideally you'd be 
phasing out unconfined altogether like Android did.  Modern kernels also 
have the /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks and 
/proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks settings, which restrict based on UID, 
but the symlink checks aren't based on the target of the symlink either.
