Hi Tushar,

Measuring "critical kernel data" is not a new infrastructure, simply a
new IMA hook.   Please update the above Subject line to "support for
measuring critical kernel data".

This is a bit better, but needs to be much clearer.  Please define
"critical data", not by example, but by describing "what" critical
kernel data is.  "There are several kernel subsystems ...."  is an
example of "how" it would be used, not a definition.  Without a clear
definition it will become a dumping ground for measuring anything
anyone wants to measure.  As a result, it may be abused.

The name of the IMA hook is ima_measure_critical_data.  This is similar
to the LSM hooks, which are prefixed with "security_".  (For a full
list of LSM hooks, refer to lsm_hook_defs.h.)

Yes, this new feature is generic, but one of the main goals of IMA is
to measure and attest to the integrity of the system, not to measure
and attest to random things.

^may want to limit the critical data being measured, quoted and
attested.
^ a new IMA policy condition is defined.

^for measuring kernel critical data early, before a custom IMA policy
...

The purpose isn't to demonstrate the "overall functionality", but to
provide an initial caller of the new IMA hook.

thanks,

Mimi
