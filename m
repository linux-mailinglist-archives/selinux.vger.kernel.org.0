True only for SGX1.

You've been talking as if "enclave loader" is tailored to the enclave it 
is loading. But in reality "enclave loader" is usually a library knowing 
usually nothing about the enclave. How could it know if an enclave 
contains self-modifying code?

You see, you've been assuming "enclave loader" knows everything and 
tailored to what it loads in a particular application. But the reality 
is the loader is generic and probably shared by multiple applications. 
It needs some generic way to figure out the "maximal protection". An 
implementation could use information embedded in the enclave file, or 
could just be "configurable". In the former case, you put extra burdens 
on the build tools, while in the latter case, your audit logs cannot 
help generating an appropriate configuration.

Say loader is configurable. By looking at the log, can an administrator 
tell which file has too restrictive "maximal protection"?

You are right. Code can always change. My assessment was made on what's 
in your patch.

The key point here is your patch is more complicated than it seems 
because you've been hand-waving on imminent requirements.
