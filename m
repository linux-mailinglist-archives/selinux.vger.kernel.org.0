> Over the past few weeks, as time allowed, I've been working on adding
> some automation to my Linux Kernel workflows.  Most of this has been

> patches, which I expect is not very interesting to most people reading
> this, but I think there is one aspect of these automations that might
> be interesting for a wider audience: basic patch sanity/verification
> tests.  These tests are intended to mimic the sanity tests I perform
> when reviewing patch submissions, things like "run checkpatch", "make
> sure it builds without error", "ensure the style/formatting is
> reasonable", etc.  For those that are curious, you can see the current
> tests in the repo below, but I will caution you that there are surely
> problems with the scripts, they are still very new and barely tested;
> expect changes.  I should also note that I haven't published the
> tool/framework which I use to run these tests just yet, but the tests
> are intended to be standalone so there should still be value as-is.

> continue, I'm leaning towards reformatting the code, but I do *really*
> want to hear what people have to say before we do this.

If you have any concerns regarding the style/formatting changes
discussed above, please speak up soon.  If I don't hear anything
within the next few days I'm going to do ahead with the style fixes.
