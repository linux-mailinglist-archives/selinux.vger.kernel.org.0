I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but the version field in the policy
is 32-bits and we are currently up to policy format v33 so we've still
got a few version numbers to play with :)

To be clear, I'm not thinking about supporting this for existing
policies, just the new policy format; the existing policy versions
would behave as they do now ... although if we do the array conversion
we will likely need to do some type of realloc()/retry or something, I
dunno, I'll leave that to you to brainstorm ;)

That's the problem we have right now.  We have to do a lot of work
(allocations, etc.) that we throw away in the case where we are
counting, not to mention that bolting on the count-only functionality
is kinda hacky/ugly (not your fault, that is just the way the code is
right now).  As you mention, the alternative is to significantly
rework how we parse/load the policy, and that isn't a very exciting
prospect as far as I'm concerned.

I'm not sure if moving over to flex array is a win, I suspect that
whatever we gain in memory savings we lose in not having direct
access.  I dunno, maybe it wouldn't be too bad.

I'm open to ideas here ... I'm looking for something that would
support the improvements for a new policy with an explicit count,
while still falling back to something that works "reasonably well" in
the current case where we have to guess.  In this case "reasonably
well" means no worse than current in terms of performance and memory
use while not over complicating the code.
