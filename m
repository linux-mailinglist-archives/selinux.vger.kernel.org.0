I have considered doing this as part of the stacking effort for quite
some time. I've already done it for the lsmblob structure that will replace
most uses of the u32 secid in the LSM APIs. I am concerned that there would
be considerable gnashing of teeth over the potential increase in the blob
sizes for kernels compiled with LSMs that aren't active. I have been frantically
avoiding anything that might slow the stacking effort further. If this would
help moving this along I'll include it in v40.
