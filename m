Oh dang. I was hoping just root access would be enough. We could,
always start a VM
with Fedora on the Travis CI machine.... It would be heavy... but its
doable. Getting
travis to move their images to non-ancient things has seemed
impossible, and then them
picking Ubuntu helps keep packages outdated :-P. I might also want to
see what we can
do for other CI options.

My approach for getting our CI in a state where we can just release
off of master if CI is
passing, was a VM + Fedora.
