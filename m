Yes, I was thinking of isid reuse, but I wasn't very clear.

That's a good point, but I see no reason why we should not preserve
that ability.  Especially since I don't see us adding a lot of new
initial SIDs in the near future.

Sorry, I misread the patch; it's fine the way it is.

I've kept your reply intact (no trimming), with the exception of my
own inline comments, since your mail didn't hit the list.  Until you
find a way to workaround your mailing list problems Stephen I would
encourage others to do the same.
