But that's another independent problem and it's not even fixed in
debugfs, which for now I'm treating as the baseline as I don't know of
any other filesystem that needs to remove its own directory trees in a
similar way.

I get that you don't want me to add a new function to the dcache API
that isn't bulletproof (and what I wrote here is apparently still far
from it), but you also previously said that I shouldn't open-code this
stuff in selinuxfs.c... I don't think I have the wits to write a
common function that handles all the possible issues, but I still want
to fix at least this one scenario (dcache_readdir() vs.
sel_remove_entries()).

Is there some way I could do this without getting a NACK from you? For
example, I thought of taking what is now debugfs_remove[_recursive]()
out of debugfs into, say, fs/libfs.c (providing some optional callback
to allow debugfs to do its __debugfs_file_removed() business) and use
this function(s) from both debugfs and selinuxfs. This way we could
later fix the leftover mount issue in one place and both filesystems
would (hopefully) immediately benefit from it. Would that be a
feasible way forward?

Thanks,
