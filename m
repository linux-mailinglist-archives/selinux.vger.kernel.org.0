I'll take a look, although just a heads-up that I don't generally
merge patches into selinux/next at this point in the -rc cycle unless
they are bug fixes, or some other critical patch; it's likely this
will need to wait until after the upcoming merge window closes.

We can, and should, look at those cases where the function parameters
start to spill into the stack space.

You're correct in that selinux_state parameters currently always point
back to the single global instance, however there was, and still is, a
point to that patch ... although I will admit it is a long time
coming.  The purpose of this change was to help pave the way for
namespacing SELinux by easing development and helping to reduce
ongoing merge conflicts with the in-development patches.  For a
variety of reasons the namespacing work has languished a bit, but it
hasn't been forgotten and I expect it to gain importance once the LSM
stacking patches land (LSM stacking alone isn't going to solve all of
the problems that many are expecting, it will need to be combined with
LSM-specific namespacing).
