I agree.  The hardest thing with writing the policyrep in setools was stuff like 
the value_to_datum indirections, type_attr_map, etc. and knowing when to use 
value vs value-1.  An API that has a new set of structs would be ideal.

Unfortunately, since setools policyrep is now written in Cython, we can't simply 
move the code over to libsepol.  My guess is dispol has the most useful building 
blocks for making a new API.
