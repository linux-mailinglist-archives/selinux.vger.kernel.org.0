With Cedric's latest patches I'd say there's only one
strategy. There's still some refinement to do, but we're
getting there.

Lead with code. I love a good requirements document, but
one of the few places where I agree with the agile folks is
that working code speaks loudly.

> Which, as I noted in my e-mail, is tantamount to security theater.

Not buying that. Not rejecting it, either. Without code
to judge it's kind of hard to say.
