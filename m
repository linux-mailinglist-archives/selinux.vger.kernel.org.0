This wasn’t part of the initial series. And I wasn’t convinced if it was
really needed. :) I added it based on the feedback in v2 of this
series. (pasted below for reference[1]).

Maybe I misunderstood your feedback at that time.

*Question*
Could you please let me know if you want us to remove this patch?
