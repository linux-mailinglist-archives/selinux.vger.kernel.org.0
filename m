I guess if there is tension be between GNU/Linux use of libselinux and
SEAndroids use of libselinux, where SE for Android is implemented by the
vendor to be immutable by the device owner, and where GNU/Linux
leverages SELinux to empower device owners, then any tension can be
alleviated if Google forks libselinux. In GNU/Linux it should just be
possible to switch policies.
