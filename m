Hi Konstantin, Alexander,

A few comments below, but can you share what testing you've done with
this?  Specifically what you've done to ensure that inodes allocated
before the policy is loaded are properly initialized/validated after
the policy is loaded?

We should just remove inode_free_security(), as well as
selinux_inode_free_security(), there is no reason to leave them as
empty functions and/or hooks.

I would suggest ending sb_finish_set_opts() by returning from the
inode_doinit_with_dentry() call, e.g.:

    /* ... */
    return inode_doinit_with_dentry(root_inode, root);
  }

There are some typos at the start of this comment that are worth
fixing here since you are updating the comment block, e.g.:

  /*
   * This can be hit on boot when a file is accessed
   * before the policy is loaded ...
