Oh, I didn't see this conflict.  Using inode_security as function
argument looks good.

I would prefer to backport the new hook.  I can help with that.  In
fact, I tried to backport the removal of the hook for Landlock, and it
requires the same amount of work, so it would be better to work
together.  That should also ease future backports impacting the same
part of the code.

BTW, while trying to backport that to linux-5.15.y I noticed that a fix
is missing in this branch: the default return value for the
inode_init_security hook, see commit 6bcdfd2cac55 ("security: Allow all
LSMs to provide xattrs for inode_init_security hook").

Indeed, I was confused with the lsm_set_blob_size() name which *adds* a
size.

Sure, this was related to my confusion with the rcu_head size addition.
