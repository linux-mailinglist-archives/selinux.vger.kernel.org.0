In my test, when kernel command line has apparmor before selinux in lsm= 
entry, the boot is not successful with enforcing=1:
systemd[1]: Failed to compute init label, ignoring.

...

Failed to drop capability bounding set of usermode helpers.
systemd[1]: Freezing execution.

Probably SELinux libraries can't find or set the labels for the PID1 or 
any file systems. Before the init label message, systemd calls 
getcon_raw(), getfilecon_raw(), string_to_security_class() and 
security_compute_create_raw(), so one of these don't understand the LSM 
stacking.

Also the policy needs updating to handle process2:setdisplay:
SELinux:  Permission setdisplay in class process2 not defined in policy.
SELinux: the above unknown classes and permissions will be denied

With enforcing=0, many services start, but for example systemd-journald 
doesn't. This is probably related to the earlier problem with labels 
(maybe libraries try to use SELinux labels where kernel wants AppArmor 
profiles):
systemd[1]: Failed to set SELinux security context 
system_u:object_r:init_runtime_t:s0 for 
/run/systemd/units/invocation:systemd-user-sessions.service: Invalid 
argument

Switching the order so that apparmor is after selinux, boot is 
successful. Loading AppArmor profiles needs a permission from SELinux:

This just seems to need TE rules for the apparmor_parser.

Double equal sign in subj_apparmor==unconfined looks odd, should that be 
just one like subj_selinux?

Tools like ps, and KDE and Gnome System Monitors only show SELinux 
context, but it would be nice if MAC contexts for all enabled LSMs were 
shown.

> Patch 15 Starts the process of changing how a security
> context is represented. Since it is possible for a
> security context to have been generated by more than one
> security module it is now necessary to note which module
> created a security context so that the correct "release"
> hook can be called. There are several places where the
> module that created a security context cannot be inferred.
> 
> This is achieved by introducing a "lsmcontext" structure
> which contains the context string, its length and the
> "slot" number of the security module that created it.
> The security_release_secctx() interface is changed,
> replacing the (string,len) pointer pair with a lsmcontext
> pointer.
> 
> Patches 16-18 convert the security interfaces from
> (string,len) pointer pairs to a lsmcontext pointer.
> The slot number identifying the creating module is
> added by the infrastructure. Where the security context
> is stored for extended periods the data type is changed.
> 
> The Netlabel code is converted to save lsmblob structures
> instead of secids in Patch 19. This is not strictly
> necessary as there can only be one security module that
> uses Netlabel at this point. Using a lsmblob is much
> cleaner, as the interfaces that use the data have all
> been converted.
> 
> Patch 20 adds checks to the binder hooks which verify
> that both ends of a transaction use the same interface LSM.
> 
> Patches 21-23 add addition audit records for subject and
> object LSM data when there are multiple security modules
> with such data. The AUDIT_MAC_TASK_CONTEXTS record is used
> in conjuction with a "subj=?" field to identify the subject
> data. The AUDIT_MAC_OBJ_CONTEXTS record is used in conjuction
> with a "obj=?" field to identify the object data.  The
> AUDIT_MAC_TASK_CONTEXTS record identifies the security module
> with the data: "subj_selinux=xyz_t subj_apparmor=abc". The
> AUDIT_MAC_OBJ_CONTEXTS record identifies the security module
> with the data: "obj_selinux=xyz_t obj_apparmor=abc".  While
> AUDIT_MAC_TASK_CONTEXTS records will always contain an entry
> for each possible security modules, AUDIT_MAC_OBJ_CONTEXTS
> records will only contain entries for security modules for
> which the object in question has data.
> 
> An example of the MAC_TASK_CONTEXTS (1420) record is:
> 
>      type=UNKNOWN[1420]
>      msg=audit(1600880931.832:113)

> Patch 24 adds a new interface for getting the compound security

> Finally, with all interference on the AppArmor hooks removed,
> Patch 25 removes the exclusive bit from AppArmor. An unnecessary
> stub hook was also removed.

> The Ubuntu project is using an earlier version of this patchset in
> their distribution to enable stacking for containers.
> 
> Performance measurements to date have the change within the "noise".
> The sockperf and dbench results are on the order of 0.2% to 0.8%
> difference, with better performance being as common as worse. The
> benchmarks were run with AppArmor and Smack on Ubuntu.
