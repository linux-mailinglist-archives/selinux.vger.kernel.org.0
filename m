Loading policydb should be very rare, and it takes for ever anyway. Booleans I have no idea. It seems to something that turns on-off quickly and there are many of them
so it will be hard to say. However I did a test. Before rcu a boolean cycle is (on my test rig) 15ms, with call_rcu 14ms and with synchronize_rcu 10ms.  Not what I expected.

And there are rcu versions for the kvfree if needed.
