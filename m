Should we infer from this comment that, of the two competing

All well taken points from an implementation perspective, but they
elide the point I was trying to make.  Which is the fact that without
any semblance of a discussion regarding the requirements needed to
implement a security architecture around the concept of a TEE, this
entire process, despite Cedric's well intentioned efforts, amounts to
pounding a square solution into the round hole of a security problem.

Which, as I noted in my e-mail, is tantamount to security theater.

Everyone wants to see this driver upstream.  If we would have had a
reasoned discussion regarding what it means to implement proper
controls around a TEE, when we started to bring these issues forward
last November, we could have possibly been on the road to having a
driver with reasoned security controls and one that actually delivers
the security guarantees the hardware was designed to deliver.

Best wishes for a productive week to everyone.
