I read this as "we want to audit this information, but we don't to
turn on the very thing which is designed to do this".  At some point,
if you want to audit things, you actually need to turn on auditing.

Aaron appeared to be complaining that if we stuck to the current best
practices regarding record formatting for the LSM generated audit
record, the record was going to get complicated when people started
adding additional information.  FWIW, I don't disagree.  The only real
alternative I've seen thus far is to look into having the LSM enable
certain records, if anyone has another idea I'm all ears/eyes.

That's a different topic, I don't think there are any remaining
objections to passing the inode information here.
