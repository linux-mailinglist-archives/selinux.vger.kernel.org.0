This could be a more easily understandable way to describe the access 
controls, at least `port` would fall to socket layer controls nicely. 
Would this division work with netifs and nodes?

It's not my terminology, the text is just moved down. I think 
fallback/static labeling part of NetLabel is not external, the labeling 
happens internally and the labels are not transmitted.
