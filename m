The AppArmor policy load? Yes, the load will fail.

What Casey is talking about is when SELinux and AppArmor are enabled in
the kernel config but AppArmor is active. This scenario is true in
distro kernels such as Ubuntu's kernel:

$ grep -e CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX= -e CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR= /boot/config-5.4.0-42-generic 
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR=y
$ cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm
lockdown,capability,yama,apparmor

Casey also likely has LSM stacking in mind here where SELinux and
AppArmor could both be active at the same time but the LSM stacking
series is not yet applied.
