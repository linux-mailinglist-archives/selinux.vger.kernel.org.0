No, that's okay. As this is both a comment and a fairly minor change
so I'll just take care of it when I merge it ... which I'm doing right
now.

Here is the newly edited comment:

  /*
   * Before the policy is loaded, translate
   * SECINITSID_INIT to "kernel", because systemd and
   * libselinux < 2.6 take a getcon_raw() result that is
   * both non-null and not "kernel" to mean that a policy
   * is already loaded.
   */

... if you think it should be different, submit a fixup patch and I'll merg=
e it.

Thanks!
