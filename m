No this is not going to work, as NFS requires labels when labels are
indeed needed by the LSM. What I'm looking for is an optimization.
What we have is functionality correct but performance might suffer for
the standard case of NFSv4.2 seclabel enabled server and clients that
don't care about seclabels.
