Hello,
I haven't seen any review of this RFC, so I decided to take a look.
The result looks quite good :) What is the current status of this
series, and can it become a "to-be-merged" patch series?

Anyway, here are some comments.

First, I was a little puzzled by the introduction of
selinux_log_sync() and the fact that it is used by
selinux_restorecon_common(), which means that callers of
selinux_restorecon() will also take the mutex log_mutex. This
surprised me because the description of one commit was very clear
about not depending very hard on libpthread... but in fact your code
is right there. I have just re-discovered the pthread helpers in
libselinux/src/selinux_internal.h :)

Nevertheless, now that I saw the pthread helpers, which enable using
libselinux without linking with libpthread, I am wondering: why is
introducing selinux_log_sync() like you do (and keeping calls to
selinux_log_sync() and selinux_log() in the code and praying that all
invocations from parallel code are converted to selinux_log_sync() )
better than introducing the mutex directly "in selinux_log()"? I
understand this is not so easy, because selinux_log is in fact a
function pointer... what I have in my mind consists in renaming the
pointer and in renaming a selinux_log_sync() to selinux_log(). This
would make the code less error-prone, regarding the issue of ensuring
to never call selinux_log callback in two parallel threads. What do
you think?

Then, when I compiled your patches with clang and some warning flags,
I got this warning:

selinux_restorecon.c:867:19: error: possible misuse of comma operator
here [-Werror,-Wcomma]
        while ((errno = 0, ftsent = fts_read(fts)) != NULL) {
                         ^
selinux_restorecon.c:867:10: note: cast expression to void to silence warning
        while ((errno = 0, ftsent = fts_read(fts)) != NULL) {
                ^~~~~~~~~
                (void)(  )
/usr/include/errno.h:38:16: note: expanded from macro 'errno'
# define errno (*__errno_location ())
               ^
1 error generated.

Using a comma operator seems to be right, here, and using the
suggested workaround to silence the compiler warning seems to be fine.

Finally, the generated file
libselinux/src/selinuxswig_python_exception.i needs to be upgraded,
because the new function selinux_restorecon_parallel is being added to
it. It would be nice to have a patch which updates this file, or to
have this update in patch "selinux_restorecon: introduce
selinux_restorecon_parallel(3)" (your choice).

Thanks!
Nicolas
