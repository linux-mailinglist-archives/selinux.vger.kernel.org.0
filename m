To be more specific, I'm curious about the cases where
__inode_security_revalidate() is called without the ability to sleep;
in those cases it is not possible to call inode_doinit_with_dentry()
to revalidate the inode's label.  With the current solution that is
not so much of an issue as sb_finish_set_opts() can block, but in your
proposed solution I worry this may be an issue.
