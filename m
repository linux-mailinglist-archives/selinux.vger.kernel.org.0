No worries, I hear even kernel developers are allowed to take time off
occasionally ... at least that's what they tell me ;)

(I hope you're enjoying the time away!)

Sure, when working across subsystems there is usually some sort of
dependency challenge which dictates which side is tackled first, I
just wanted to make sure we don't consider one side "done" until we
finish both sides.

Sure, I'm pretty flexible on how we do these things, I just want it to
end up fixed in Linus' tree and there are plenty of ways we can make
that happen :)

Okay, let me do the investigation mentioned above to make sure this is
possible and report back (I need to refresh my memory first, the
holiday break kinda flushed this out of my mind ;).
