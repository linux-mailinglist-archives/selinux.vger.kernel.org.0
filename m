Two things:

* I'm not sure you want to reuse a port type as a socket type, that
seems wrong to me.

* The socket type transition I was talking about would be new as there
is not currently a type transition when the kernel creates a new
socket for incoming connections.

Well, regardless of who wrote the code, setsockcreatecon() is not
going to have any effect on a socket's label if it is called *after*
the socket is created.  Additionally, setsockcreatecon() has no effect
on child sockets created by incoming connections on a listening
socket; if you want to affect the label of those child sockets today
you would need to change the label of the listening parent socket.

I'll leave that to the folks who better understand the SELinux
libraries, my only comment would be that I'm not sure reusing the port
label is a good idea here.
