This is only settable internally to keep special keys, such as the blackli=

loaded from the EFI BIOS, from being removed.

So that the sysadmin can clear, say, the NFS idmapper keyring or invalidat=

DNS lookup keys.

The kernel upcalls by spawning a daemon.  I want to change this as it's no=
t
compatible with containers since namespaces make this problematic.

The request_key() system call will do this.  The normal use case is someth=
ing
like the AFS filesystem asking for a key so that it can do an operation.  =
The
possibility exists for the kernel to upcall, say, to something that does a=
klog
on behalf of the user - but aklog in turn needs to get the TGT out of the
keyrings.

No.  I don't even know what the target creds will necessarily be at this
point.

The keyring testsuite.  No idea about the SELinux one.

The following:

 (1) Passing the wrong type of key to KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE now gets you
     EOPNOTSUPP rather than ENOKEY.  This is now as documented in the manu=
al
     page.

 (2) Passing key ID 0 or an invalid negative key ID to KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE n=
ow
     gets you EINVAL rather than ENOKEY.

 (3) Passing key ID 0 or an invalid negative key ID to KEYCTL_READ now get=
s
     you EINVAL rather than ENOKEY.

Technically, it consistutes an ABI change, I suppose, but I think it is
probably sufficiently minor.

Or maybe on (2) and (3) I should go the other way.  You get ENOKEY for inv=
alid
key IDs (such as 0 or unsupported negative ones) across all callers of
lookup_user_key().  This would at least by consistent with the manual page=
s.

It's what you asked for.

Now, I don't know if the LSM needs to know that the main keyutils permissi=
ons
checker invoked an override.  At least one of the overrides will have gone
through the LSM anyway when capable() was called.

I'll consider it.  But I really need to get what I'm going to include in t=
he
middle of the notifications patchset sorted now - or risk the notification=
s
and fsinfo patchsets getting bumped again.

Maybe what's needed is a pair of hooks whereby the call to capable() is
replaced with LSM hook specifically to ask about the overrides:

	security_key_use_sysadmin_override(key, cred);
	security_key_use_construction_override(key, cred);

And/or a hook to ask whether the process is allowed to do the request_key(=
)
call that they want:

	security_request_key(struct key_type *type,
			     const char *description,
			     struct key_tag *domain_tag,
			     const void *callout_info,
			     size_t callout_len,
			     void *aux);

I don't really want to do a "can the kernel delegate to process X?" hook j=
ust
at the moment, since I want to change/extend that code and I don't want to
commit to any particular security information being present yet.

I can go back to the enum patch for the moment if you and Casey can put up
with that for the moment?
