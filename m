Thanks for working on this. On my side, I have a minor comment,
related to the second patch:

+    <list name="keywords">
+        <item>auditallow</item>
+        <item>tunableif</item>
+        <item>allow</item>
+        <item>dontaudit</item>
...
I find it easier to maintain if the items were sorted in alphabetical
order (this enables inserting new items if the need comes one day,
without wondering whether the new items should be at the end of the
list or if the order should match the one used in some source
files...). Or, if you want to keep this order, please add comments
describing how the lists were created, in order to ease future
modifications.

Thanks,
Nicolas
