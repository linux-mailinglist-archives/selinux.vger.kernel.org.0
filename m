Okay, I don't know where I got the "5" boundary from... maybe my brain
just made it up.

Well, for a start we could increase the default to 2, which should
only remove those attributes that have only one type. That has
practically no downsides (other than making it a bit harder to trace
the rule back to source policy) and would be just enough to make the
optimization work nicely.

I wouldn't change the default to higher values than that for now,
since such values already trade off policy size increase for rule
lookup performance, which is more of a gray area.
