Given the rarity of SMC, require enclaves to declare "I do SMC"...  The
Intel SDK already requires the enclave developer to declare heap size,
stack size, thread affinity, etc...  I have a very hard time believing
that it can't support SMC and relocation flags.

No, I'm assuming that an enclave can communicate its basic needs without
undue pain.

I'm contending the "extra burdens" is minimal.

  if (do_smc || do_relocation)
          max_prot = RWX;
  else
          max_prot = SECINFO.FLAGS;

Again, this fails irrespective of LSMs.  So the answer is "no", because
there is no log.  But the admin will never have to deal with this issue
because the enclave will *never* run, i.e. would unconditionally fail to
run during initial development.  And the developer has bigger problems if
they can't debug their own code.
