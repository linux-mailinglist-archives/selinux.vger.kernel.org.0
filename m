I like this idea.

I like this idea in general.

If a child namespace is sharing a filesystem, can it change labels? It
seems like allowing that could cause problems. At the very least, it
seems like we would want the option to be able to restrict the child
from changing labels.

This might be over-engineering things, but in general it seems like we
want to specify which namespace owns the labels on a filesystem and
whether parent or child namespaces see one label for the whole
filesystem or all the labels (and whether or not they can change
them).

This seems different from what you described above. Above it seems to
say that if a parent mounted a filesystem and shared it with a child,
the child would see the labels. But here it looks like the parent can
mount a filesystem while specifying that it is the child that controls
the labels and the parent sees just one label. I think this is the
right approach.

This implies the immediate child. Thinking theoretically (I don't know
why you would do this) if you were planning on having four nested
SELinux namespaces, but wanted the very bottom child to control a
particular filesystem, its immediate parent would have to set it up.
That seems reasonable to me.

Unless there is a way to share a filesystem, but with a single label.

I think that this approach has merit. The devil is in the details of
course. I am curious to hear what others think.

Thanks,
