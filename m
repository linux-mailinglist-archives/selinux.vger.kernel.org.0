Ooof, that's unfortunate :/  Thanks for reporting it though ...

Agreed, I'm not sure I want to push for this as a fix.

2a. (?)  Another option would simply be ensuring that the subflow
socket has the proper LSM/SELinux label from the start.  This is
arguably The Right Thing To Do regardless, and in cases where explicit
packet labeling is used, e.g. CALIPSO, it may be necessary to do this
to ensure the traffic is labeled correctly from the start (I would
need to spend more time looking at the MPTCP code to say for certain
here).

I'm not sure we want to open that can of worms right now.

I'm not sure we want to start calling security_socket_post_create()
twice on a given socket, *maybe* it works okay now but that seems like
an awkward constraint to put on future LSMs (or changes to existing
ones).  If we decide that the best approach is to add a LSM hook call
here, we should create a new hook instead of reusing an existing one;
I think this falls under Ondrej's possible solution #2.

However, I think this simplest solution might be what I mentioned
above as #2a, simply labeling the subflow socket properly from the
beginning.  In the case of SELinux I think we could do that by simply
clearing the @kern flag in the case of IPPROTO_MPTCP; completely
untested (and likely whitespace mangled) hack shown below:

... of course the downside is that this is not a general cross-LSM
solution, but those are very hard, if not impossible, to create as the
individual LSMs can vary tremendously.  There is also the downside of
having to have a protocol specific hack in the LSM socket creation
hooks, which is a bit of a bummer, but then again we already have to
do so much worse elsewhere in the LSM networking hooks that this is
far from the worst thing we've had to do.

All this of course assumes that the quick little hack even works, I
may be missing something very obvious ... ;)
