We could also partially mitigate the problem by linking libsepol
statically into setools at build time. I suggested this in [1] for
Fedora at least, but in general there is the problem that you need to
know the exact path to libsepol.a in setup.py [2]. I don't have enough
experience with python libraries to know if this can be implemented
directly in the upstream setup.py script in a reasonably generic way.

If linked statically, at least it wouldn't segfault after an update to
an incompatible libsepol.so. It would still fail to build with the new
headers, but at least this turns from a user-visible bug to only
packager's & maintainer's problem.
