Ok, fair point - sorry for the confusion.

Yes, that could be true. I suppose a better requirement would be to
provide sufficient instructions that a reasonable third party could
re-create the conditions necessary to exercise the tests.
That could just be providing the steps that the patch author took to
run the tests themselves.

Good idea - will do that.

Yep, but unfortunately was missing from the testsuite patch
description when it was posted.
