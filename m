I'm experimenting with using Fedora CI for this, see https://src.fedoraproj=
ect.org/rpms/policycoreutils/pull-request/15

It uses Fedora Rawhide images and runs
https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/plautrba/rpms/policycoreutils/blob/a9622=
b610a0f7cfb968d4cb216c9c5c42e87b6dd/f/tests/upstream/runtest.sh
script which is part of this PR


You can see a failure in Fedora CI:
https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/blue/organizations/jenk=
ins/fedora-rawhide-pr-pipeline/detail/fedora-rawhide-pr-pipeline/3441/pipel=
ine/
-> Artifacts -> package-tests/logs/FAIL-upstream.log -
https://jenkins-continuous-infra.apps.ci.centos.org/job/fedora-rawhide-pr-p=
ipeline/3441/artifact/package-tests/logs/FAIL-upstream.log

So far there's only userspace build and tests but it can be used for
selinux-testsuite and (Fedora) kernel.

It has one downside, it can be triggered only by a pull request on https://=
src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/policycoreutils
