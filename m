The hole idea with MAC is that you should explicit declare what is allowed.

Starting with anything unconfined is a bad idea for anything that is seen
from the internet. If you do it for the security your tcpserver should have it's own
domain that is not unconfined. And then you can give rules on what it is allowed
to start.  So you need to create a tcpservice_service_t, so your rule should be

allow tcpservice_service_t sshd_exec_t:file { execute
		execute_no_trans getattr ioctl map open read };

/* execute_no_trans is probably not what you want */

 But you do NOT want

allow tcpservice_service_t unconfined_t:process dyntransition;


On fedora it would be like:

allow tcpservice_service_t sshd_t:process dyntransition;

and sshd is then allowed to create unconfined shell or what ever.
