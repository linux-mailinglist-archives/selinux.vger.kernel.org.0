Ignoring setsockcreatecon(3) as that really isn't an option here,
sockets created via socket(2) do check to see if there is a type
transition defined in the policy.  In the case of a TCP socket the
type transition would look something like this:

  type_transition <domain> <domain>:tcp_socket <new_socket_type>

... so you can see there is not much one can select on other than the
socket's object class.  The reason is that the socket(2) call itself
is rather spartan, with not even any clue as to if this is a client or
server socket in the case of TCP.

Taking a step back, what are you trying to do?  Perhaps there is
another approach that would get you where you want to go.
