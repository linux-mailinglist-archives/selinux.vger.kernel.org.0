It's up to the owner of the trace event. I only replied to why pointers
in general are useful, but they are mostly just "ids" to map to other
trace events.

We have the libtraceevent that should be used for parsing raw trace
events in binary form. The library (which currently lives in the
kernel's tools/lib/traceeevnt directory) I'm trying to get to have its
own home that distros can package. It should never be an issue adding
another field to an event, as the library gives the tools the ability
to find a field of an event regardless of where it is positioned, and
also let the tools know if the field exists or not.

If that's what you are asking.
