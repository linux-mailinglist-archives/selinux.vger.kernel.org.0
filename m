I think the compatibility challenges with adding another field to a
SELinux label at this point in time, e.g.
namespace:user:role:type:mls, would make an already challenging task
almost impossible.  I'm also not sure how one would handle nested
namespaces with this approach, add additional namespace fields to the
label?
