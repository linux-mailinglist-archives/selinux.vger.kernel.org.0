Thanks.  I also want to stress that capturing the logic behind the
decision in the patch description / comments is almost as important
(maybe more so) than what we end up deciding on for the actual size
algorithm.  I can almost guarantee the decision made now is going to
be brought up for discussion at some point in the future, so let's
help the poor future devs as much as we can ;)
