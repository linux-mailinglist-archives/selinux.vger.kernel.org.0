I understand performance improvements were not the main motivation
behind this patchset, but I'm somewhat concerned that policy load time
*almost* triples in the case of an unmodified policy with this patch
applied.  Since that will be most everyone as soon as this patch is
applied, that regression does concern me ... I'm not sure just yet how
much it concerns me, but it isn't trivial.
