It might be worth looking into adding some functionality to allow the
LSMs to have some control about when/where to enable auditing.  While
selectively adding records once the denial is triggered isn't going to
be possible (it's too late to collect some of the information we would
want, e.g. file information), it should be possible to allow the LSM
to trigger per-process audit record collection without too much
trouble.  We could potentially take it a step further and on those
processes which have had auditing enabled by the LSM we could allow
the LSM to select when these additional records would be emitted (e.g.
on access denial); you would still incur the collection overhead, but
the logs would be much less.

We've been doing a lot of work to associate related records so that
you don't have to deal with the problem you're describing.  If you are
still seeing problematic records on a modern kernel I would like to
hear about it.
