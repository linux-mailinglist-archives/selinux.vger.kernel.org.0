When you subscribed to the mailing list you were sent instructions on
how to unsubscribe from the mailing list.

The SELinux developer's mailing list is managed via
majordomo@vger.kernel.org, in order to unsubscribe you need to send an
email to that address with "unsubscribe selinux" in the body of the
email.
